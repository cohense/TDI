We are not sure if she is just a very small greyhound or perhaps mixed with whippet.  She was a stray at the animal shelter, not tattooed, not from the racing industry."

Ted is a funny little man. We've had him in the group for nearly 3 years, but we just recently decided to move him to adoptable status. At the shelter, this guy was begging for attention. Shortly after arriving at his foster mom's home, he became grumpy with her. He was also grumpy during his first vet visit, and frankly, the vet wasn't sure if Ted would be adoptable for behavioral reasons.

Here we are, and Ted is still a work in progress. Ted had a bit of a weight problem so he been moved into a new foster home where his foster mom is able to monitor his food intake and give him regular walks.  Ted loves walks, and now he's trim!!

Tedâs foster mom is also working on his grumpiness. And she thinks she's making progress! While as first Ted would grumble when his foster mom tried to love on him, she thinks he is starting to like the attention. He accepts her kisses and will even cuddle in her neck.  He grumbles most when he is snuggled in his bed so his foster mom gives him his space at these times.  Luckily, Ted definitely loves strangers and other dogs. He regularly runs up to everyone he sees with his tail wagging to seek attention and say hi. Then he tries to follow them home!

An ideal home is a quiet and patient one without children that understands that he needs his space at times.  Ted would love to spend his days both lounging around and taking regular walks.

Adoption fee is $200.

Astro likes to take long walks on the greenbelt with his foster mommy. He enjoys sightseeing and admiring Mother Nature. Astro would do well in a SUPER patient home with just adults. He takes awhile to warm up before he trusts people, and then he's stuck on his people like glue. He would benefit best from a home where he can be allowed to take his time to show his true self and one that will continue to let his confidence grow with positive reinforcement for all the things that he does so well. He gets along with the dog in his foster home and is tolerant of the cats as well.

8,"Please contact Michele (bygolley1@aol.com) for more information about this pet.Oh, brother! Mom got frustrated taking pictures of me because I was always sticking my tongue out. Well, when she took me to the doctor for a senior physical, she learned that I have a cleft lip. My doctor is a published feline veterinarian, and he hadn't seen that before, so his assistant took a photo and who knows, I might end up in a book someday! I'll be glad to autograph it for you if/when that happens. He also said he didn't think I was all that old, but just 'rode hard and put up wet.' So you see, I need someone who is going to give me a nice home where a laid-back, quiet kitty can get her chance to live in the lap of luxury.
I adore humans and love to be petted, but I'm not nuts about cats. I might prefer to be an only, but I may not need to be. What I can tell you is that I sure don't need as many cats as there are in my foster home or in my RV. I don't really like to be picked up, but that's no big deal, now is it?
Foster mom will try to get a better photo, but you can see I'm pretty cute, can't you? And maybe I even tug at your heartstrings? Are you interested in making me happy by petting me and sitting on the couch with me? Please? Email foster mom to arrange a meeting when I return to Texas from my travels to the west coast.

She is still somewhat shy with humans but when you start petting her while she is sleeping, her motor starts and her paws begin to move as she starts making biscuits.

26,"Please contact Rae (rae@luvzhorses.com) for more information about this pet.Hi There,My name is Bria and I was living at the Comanche, TX shelter when they discovered I was pregnant. They scurried and made arrangements for me to get out of the shelter ASAP so I wouldn't have my babies there.The nice ladies at Comanche, especially Laurie and Kimberly worked quickly and got me to ASR and into a foster home on Tuesday and I had my babies on Thursday! Talk about the nick of time!I am the proud healthy mother of three little cuties who will be up for adoption in 8-10 weeks time. I will then need my own forever home and if you would like to have me as a BFF please come to meet me. I'm a very loving girl and a really good Mom and I purr all the time!5/6/16 UPDATE: Bria has come a very long way and is now ready for a forever home. She is a silly, bouncy kitty with a bit of 'tude', but she is friendly and ready for more. She isn't really comfortable with most of the kitties in our home, but plays with Darth as if he was her baby or she was his sister. She has gotten a lot more comfortable with humans as well. She will rub up against my legs and allow me to pet her on the head and chest and one or two strokes down her back and then gets excited and sends 'warning' signals. I think she just gets easily over stimulated, but she can be a bit nippy so she is not a good choice for a family with small children. She would be great as a companion for an adult home with one other kitty as long as she is allowed plenty of time to acclimate and get used to the other kitty. I do believe that if Bria has a home of her own where she has more area to roam (right now she stays basically in one big bedroom) she will come completely out of her fear shell and become a really sweet and loving kitty. Won't you tkae a chance on this girl? She deserves a place of her own after such a rough start.UPDATE: July 2017 - Bria is definately a good candidate for an adult home with one or even two other kitties. She is now integrated into the population and managing nicely. She isn't agressive and will back down from confrontation but sometimes she will defend herself a bit. She still is a sweet girl but still gets a bit over excited at too much petting. She really needs a quiet home where she can ask for and get the attention and love she deserves. She'd make a great companion! 10/27/18 10:09 PM"

38,"Esther came to our rescue with a huge hernia, mammoth tumors and needed to be spayed. She struggled with gaining weight and an infection but now she has healed and is at a healthy weight! 
Esther loves to lay around and cuddle on the sofa. She would love to meet a new companion and have a forever home. She is so cute with her big airplane ears when she looks up and is very sweet. She doesn't bark or whine only grunts and moans.  She just is not a complainer. She is working on her potty training and will go potty outside when taken out. She loves to go for walks and walks good on a leash. Esther is fine with other dogs and cats around as long as she can sit with you too. She does have some seeing issues but finds her way around the house and outside just fine."
39,"A note from Lucy and Rex: My name is Lucy. I am a Cocker Spaniel and this is my miniature Pinscher brother Rex. My foster mom says I am a sweet girl with very nice manners. Rex and I had a nice home but our mama had to go into assisted living and there was no one to take care of us so we are looking for a new home. We really, really love each other so much that we sleep right next to each other and we eat our meals from the same bowl. We want to be adopted together because we don't like being apart. I am blind in one eye, but take drops in both eyes twice a day. My foster mom says it is to help me keep my good eye.
My name is Rex. I am the cute boy on the left. I love my sister Lucy and share everything with her. I have good manners and I am very playful. I will do best in a house without cats because I like to chase them. We like to eat, but our foster mom says we both need to lose weight. That's alright with me as long as I can be with Lucy. Will someone love us?

This little guy came to us with a curious sort of medical condition--a severe headtilt. Multiple vet visits have not revealed the cause, but with daily massage, the head tilt has gotten much less pronounced.  We believe it may be inner ear related.

He loves leash walks, toys, playing a little ball, napping in the sun and snuggling. 

He is an older gent and came to us needing to gain a few pounds - and thanks to his great appetite, he has. 
He is crate trained, house trained and loves to go for car rides. 
He is wary of strange dogs but gets along great with his three foster brothers.
He takes daily medication for a heart murmur but his activity is not restricted.

I do need to watch my diet so my skin doesnât get too itchy, and I do have a little hearing loss. My eyes are clear though and my sniffer works overtime finding treats if you have treat toys!!

doggy door in minutes. She is spayed and heartworm negative. Sheâs about two years old and loaded with energy. She loves to play, either with another dog or her person. She lives for walks, which she reminds me of daily by tapping the front door. She gets along well with other dogs and she respects the
catâs space. She would do well having a job of herding anything or of keeping squirrels off the premises.But she wants to curl up next to her person at night, and yes, I have spoiled her rotten.She wants so badly to be your best friend, and she follows me from room to room, settling down next to
me, even if itâs for 30 seconds. She has a beautiful bandit face with tan eyebrows and trim, and hercurly, shiny coat is problem free. She doesnât seem to be a shedder. Maui is fostering in the San Antonio area."

Buddy Boy is fostering in the Austin Area."
51,"Beautiful Miss Priss is a little shy when she first meets you. It doesn't take her very long to warm up, but at first she might be a little nervous. In her previous life, she was used for breeding so she REALLY does not like having her stomach touched and can be a little sensitive about it--for that reason, we're going to be extra cautious and say that Priss should go to a home with adults only or older kids only--as kids often like to hug and pick up and that is certainly not something Priss would like at all. Now that's out of the way, the good news is: she is otherwise just an angel and SUPER sweet when she knows you. Such a lovebug!  Priss is about 4-5 years old. She has a heartmurmur that is treated with monthly medications.  Unfortunately, she is also heartworm positive and is being treated at CSRA expense. Priss fosters in the Austin area."
52,"Please read very carefully as we do consider Serena to be ""special needs"" in that she is EXTREMELY shy.  She is not the type of dog to fit into a bustling family life--she needs quiet and understanding with someone very experienced. 

This sweet little girl came to rescue as a stray and is just dying to be loved, but is working on her fear and trust issues. She will do best in a home where her primary caregiver is female, and where there is another dog who can be her companion and show her how to be a dog, and no tiny children. She's quite afraid of men, but loves other dogs. She's timid but we see glimpses of a vivacious and playful personality on those rare occasions when she lets her guard down.  She proceeds with caution - she may run up for a quick hug and moan in delight, and will run away just as quick! Serena prefers to dine alone, away from people, and likes having her own space via a crate, and loves exploring the back yard. She just completed two months of heartworm treatment and feels a lot better. She recently learned to walk on a lease and finds she loves daily walks. This beautiful girl has lots of love to give and will grow in confidence given enough time, patience and love. Serena is fostering in the Austin area.

He can be shy at first but it doesnât take him long to warm up if you have a treat in hand. Holden is fostering in the Austin area."
54,"It's Puffin!  This little spaniel mix girlie is shy with new people but soon enough sheâs a cuddler and wants to be petted. Everyone who meets her falls in love with her  gentle and sweet personality, but she also gives some strong puppy eyes!). She prefers a slow pace so short walks, plenty of couch time, and likes to keep herself busy with a chew treat. Puffin doesnât like the company of other dog and would prefer to be the only princess. She is 17lbs and bonus: sheâs potty trained!  Puffin is about a year and a half old.

Sheila is my hero. She's absolutely fearless as she makes her way in her darkened world. The first night she was exploring the back yard to make sure there weren't lizards or bunnies invading her territory. She hasn't been exposed to cats but she likes the deer that feed outside the fence, even going up to them and poking her nose through the fence so she can get acquainted. She maneuvers quite well around the house and yard, responding to ""Watch"" when she looks like she is going to hit something and then she changes direction.

She makes her wishes known by coming to me and nuzzling to let me know it's time to go outside. But my favorite is when she does her happy dance at mealtimes. She does a little growl and then she turns round and round on her hind legs, tail going ninety miles an hour (that's unofficial but I have it on good authority). She's easy going about bedtime, she likes the big bed but is perfectly content in her own bed as well. She is happy with other dogs but if they try to get between her and her treats, she lets them know that isn't acceptable, food is very important to Sheila!

I had never thought about dealing with a blind dog and was little apprehensive, but she has taught me that it's really no different from a sighted dog, they all need to be loved and appreciated. If you give Sheila a chance for her forever home, you won't be disappointed. I think she will amaze you the way she has me.

This Little Man is a Doxie Ambassador and makes sure everyone who is within sight gets the pleasure of meeting and loving on Mr. F! When coming into rescue, Freckles was extremely underweight, caused by all of his rotten teeth, not allowing him to eat. Thankfully he is heartworm negative, and is otherwise pretty healthy. He has had a dental, which removed all his teeth except his 4 large canines! The bottom canines kind of stick out giving him a 'Boar hog' appearance, which adds to his charm!

He is back at a nice weight of 12 lbs, has gain his muscle tone and energy back, and his Black and Sliver Dapple coat has returned! He is a good looking little man! Even without the majority of his teeth, he can eat just about anything he wants including regular kibble. But I do cut or break up Big Stuff. He LOVES licking and sucking on Rib Bones! He does have a full cataract in 1 eye and has trouble seeing in very low light. A nightlight lets him motor around after dark. If he gets lost or disoriented, he will call out for help. Freckles, being a 'little social Butterfly' loves People, Kids, Cats, other Dogs, Birds and Squirrels! He is a very inquisitive little man, and will follow his Person around to see what they are doing and what he can help with. When we go outside to potty, he checks out everyone and everything. He likes to explore his surroundings and will take you for a walk to see new things and meet new people! His favorite thing in the whole world is his Human Person! His job in life is to keep his Person company and safe. If his person is not with him or he can't find his person, he will stand still, make his 'homing Call', letting his person know they are lost and need to follow 'the Call' to rejoin Freckles and Be safe again! Freckles is an Energetic Senior Citizen at around 13 yrs of age so he does need a few naps a day to keep up his energy. He sleeps soundly in the big bed at night with his blankie pulled over his head. During the day he prefers a lap or any soft place. Freckles was given up to a Dallas/Ft Worth shelter by his previous owners who had him since he was a puppy, because he was old and they wanted a new puppy. Mr. F is a happy, healthy, energetic little man that has been a Faithful Companion to his people all his life, asking only for food, shelter, a soft bed and some love.

When we first started fostering Romeo, he was very shy and would not respond to being petted; he tried to back away to keep us from touching him. It took almost a month for him to start responding to us--regarding us with leery eyes He has since become a very affectionate dog. After his heart-worm treatment, he has become more energetic and playful. When he is in his comfort zone, he likes to roll over and have his chest rubbed. He eats well and is very happy when he sees his food bowl. He is very inquisitive about things around the house, especially if he thinks it might be something to eat. He likes walking, if the weather is nice--he is not fond of wet, misty weather. He does not lollygag during his walks--he likes to keep moving and investigating the world around him. Because of his thick coat, Romeo needs to brushed, especially the area around his ears and hindquarters. Romeo has large expressive eyes, especially when he wants to stop walking in the wet grass and go inside the house. He has shown no inclination to chew on furniture, shoes, or plastic items. He has shown no interest in balls or toys. He does not jump on people. He has not been exposed to cats or children. Romeo needs to be in a home where there are no other dogs.

UPDATE:
Thor is progressing, but it's a slow work in progress. He's not marking as much, and he's very slowly learning to stand down when he's overwhelmed by the urge to protect. He's definitely not the dog for your average family, but in a home with no or few other animals (no alphas) he could be someone's best buddy forever. He does have a very sweet and cuddly side, and we're continuing to work to let that shine through. If you've ever wanted to rescue an animal purely for the sake of the animal, and are willing to work to save this boy, then he would love you for it for the rest of his days.
Thor's come a long way since being pulled off the streets of San Antonio. He's had a heart workup to make sure he's OK for anesthesia (neuter), and he's put on a little bit of weight so he's not just skin and bones. This boy's had a rough life, and he still has some aggression issues with my pig, but he's learned to accept and interact with other dogs and people. He still requires careful observation, but he really has come so far! We're still working on marking, although he's improving. Whomever adopts him needs to understand he requires some patience and understanding. If you can offer him those, then you'll have a dog who loves and adores you! 10/25/18 10:58 PM"

Jake is a special Dachshund. He's intelligent, engaging, and adorable. He expects a lot of attention and is readily willing to give his back. He wants to be number one and is not too happy having to share the limelight with other pets.

He may pick fights with other dogs in order to assert his superior position.

He likes being next to his caregiver on the couch or in the bed, and tolerates being carried around pretty well. He has had basic obedience training and did well. There's probably little limit to how far he could go training-wise. He understands the nuances of what he should do and will perform if he knows it's to his advantage -- like there's a treat in the offing.

He frequently does not obey if there's no benefit to him.

He's not destructive of household items other than leather shoe laces which he can't resist.

He enjoys walks and is always eager to go.

He likes to stop and investigate often and always barks at dogs he meets along the route.

He has good stamina. Jake would fit perfectly into a household with no other pets and where he was not left alone for other than short periods of several hours.

He is house trained but has occasional accidents if left alone unconfined too long.

Because of his intelligence he thrives on stimulation and activity.

He does love being in his crate; however, so he can adapt to some periods of aloneness.

I can use a doggie door and go potty all by myself. My foster mom gets really excited when I go potty outside and so do I. I am crate trained but would rather not be in there. I still have lots of puppy in me so make sure you put your shoes up. I havenât chewed any up, but every time my foster mom or siblings take them off, I like to grab them and move them. I like toys! They are so much fun to play with. I found out this week that there is something called a belly rub. Let me tell you, it is the best thing EVER! It is so amazing. I love to give kisses and cuddle. I have slept in bed with my foster mom and dad a few times. I am so good at night. I sleep and donât get up. I like to be right next to them and curl up. I still need to learn my basic commands and I will. It just takes some time. In my foster home I have lots of foster brothers. Some have 2 legs and some have 4 legs. They are pretty cool. I donât care if my furever home has other dogs or not. I havenât met a cat so I donât know if I like them or not. Anyway, I really want to get adopted and have my own furever family.

He has staked out a favorite dog bed, is very proficient with the doggie door and found a couple places to sleep he really likes. He enjoys couch time with his foster parents and is always up for being petted. He does not stuff himself at meal time - he is the kind of dog where you could leave his bowl down all day and he would eat when he is hungry. He is not big on toys, except for his favorite bed, which he likes to play with. Choco is heart worm positive so he will be undergoing treatment for the next few months.

88,"After a full day of staking out a trap in a hot car in Beeville in August, sometime shortly  after dark, we finally heard the snap of the trap door and found sweet, scared Minnie inside. She wasnât Minnie then...just another stray running the streets, completely feral and uncatchable. The only thing that differentiated her from the other strays there, was that her companion, Bea (mom or sister?), had been slowly strangling with a mangled animal cracker tub stuck over head for a year. Bea had been caught and Minnie was alone. But not for long. Since the snap of that trap 10 months ago, Minnie has been learning to trust people. The sparkle in a dogâs eyes when they see a human they love is finally shining in Minnieâs. 
A sweet girl to the core, Minnie rarely barks, never growls, and is tolerant of just about anything. She is still a bit skittish and alert, but has grown into a love bug. She loves playing in the yard for hours at a time, is great on a leash, and her dog companions are still her âride or die.â She sleeps at the foot of the bed and likes to give kisses in the morning. She feels safe in her crate and will go there when she gets nervous or just to hang out, but if she sees you pull out a treat, sheâll run there to wait for hers. She likes ear and belly scratches. She wants to please and is working on learning how. Since coming out of her shell, she sometimes gets excited and jumps up to get attention from the people she loves. She needs someone who will be patient and help her learn how to ask in polite ways, and who will understand her skittishness and help her continue to be brave in the world with humans.  Mostly Minnie is just a sweet girl who has finally figured out that people are not out to get her and just want to love her. And sheâs so excited to give that love back. 
She will be at her best in a home with another dog to play with and to help give her confidence, with adults or older children (fast and unpredictable grabs from small kids are still a bit overwhelming for her), and not with cats. She recently went to an off-leash dog park trail for the first time and did great, so she will likely not be a flight risk after an adjustment period.

97,"A letter from Daisy's foster mom:  Daisy is by far my favorite foster ever.  I cannot keep her, but I hope to find her a fantastic home where she can live out her days happily and loved.  Daisy loves people and seeks affection from anyone she meets.  Daisy likes to lean against her people or sit down on their feet to make sure that theyâre as close as possible.  Daisy also likes to bury her head against her people to feel completely submerged in their affection.  Daisy also has a very enthusiastic wag, it takes over her entire body and she seems a bit befuddled as to why she canât walk straight.    Daisy is generally a low energy dog but she enjoys a bit of energetic play time each morning and evening.  She loves her rope toys and will play with them by herself (tossing, shaking, and chewing) or with her people (playing tug).  She also enjoys chewing on tennis balls.    For treats, Daisyâs most favorite treat is the bully stick, but sheâs treat motivated and is willing to try anything once (and most things more often).  Daisy rarely barks but will alert bark if a stranger comes on the property.  When sheâs just hanging around the house, Daisy has a lot to say, she has a wide variety of grunts, grumbles, guffaws and other quiet vocalizations that she uses to talk to her people.  Daisy has good house manners and is fully house trained.  Sheâs also crate trained, enjoys napping in her crate often during the day, and is trustworthy when left alone uncrated.  Daisy has lived with another dog in the past, but sheâs selective about her dog friends so a meet and greet is recommended.  Sheâs a Classic Canine so she comes with lots of extra love and support.  Daisy is suitable for particularly big-hearted adopters who can look past the physical imperfections that make her look like she fell out of the bottom of the ding and dent bin.  On the inside, sheâs a beautiful dog.  On the outside, sheâs missing half an ear, has kinked tail, and a loose undercarriage from nursing many puppies.  Any adopter who can look past that will see that Daisy is a gem.  If you want to meet Daisy and learn more, email caring@classiccanines.org"

102,"Adelia is currently living in a foster home and her foster mom has this to say about her:  Adelia (also known as 'Deli', 'Lil Deli', or 'Couch Bear') is friendly, affectionate, loves her walks but also loves lounging on the couch and snuggling (hence the nickname 'Couch Bear'), loves her people (always following around/wants to be nearby), and is perfectly adorable! When she gets very excited, she tap dances moving and tapping her front feet really quickly. Also, every morning when she wakes up, she stretches and then army crawls across the bed or floor before finally deciding to stand up. SO CUTE!!  Adelia is looking for a forever home, so contact her foster mom at ginadestaffany@gmail.com to adopt this cute Couch Bear!  Check out Adelia playing with her foster sister!"
103,I have my own webpage!   I'll be much more relaxed and friendly away from the shelter and all these cats!
104,"Outgoing, Goofy, Cat-Social Holly George has the cutest booty! He is an orange tabby/Manx mix so his tail is super short, giving him an adorable bunny bum. He is affectionate with all people and loves to be petted. In fact, he will tap you on the arm to request for you to pet him! He also will give you nose kisses - touch his nose gently and sweetly to yours - to let you know how much he loves you. Super sweet and loving! Holly George has Manx Syndrome; basically, the gene that gave him his short tail also shortened his spine, which caused him to be incontinent and unable to pee on his own. This is where you come in! His human needs to 'express - apply light pressure in a particular way - Holly George's bladder a few times a day to help him urinate. For more information, please contact APA! In addition to people, Holly George is social with other cats, too, and would love to have a feline buddy (or two) to hang out with in his new home. He has grown up around cats of all ages and accepts all of them. He will snuggle with them and groom them, and he will play with them, too! He also likes a variety of toys - balls, string toys, feather toys - and a scratching post to scratch and climb. He is young and active! Holly George has some special needs, and we think the perfect home for him is with patient people who will love and appreciate him! His human companion should be able to express his bladder and keep him clean (he is a little sensitive around his back end, so he likes to be handled gently); other than that, all Holly George needs is company, love and affection, and to be played with. He would be best with adults and young adults, rather than little kids. Though Holly George is friendly and outgoing, he likely will need time to adapt to his new home and family. But once he is comfortable, we think you will agree that he is an over-the-top wonderful cat! Contact us today for more information, and to set up a meet and greet. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

105,"Shy, Quiet, Playful Ellsworth is a cutie-pie tabby cat with a lot of love to give! He has a calm and sweet demeanor that makes him a wonderful companion cat. This little cuddle monster has some special needs, which has made him one of our longest-stay cats. All Ellsworth wants is a home of his own. Ellsworth was born with Manx Syndrome, a defect that causes him to be incontinent. This means he needs a compassionate owner who will help him express his urine a few times a day; this sounds harder than it actually is, and APA! will provide instruction on how to do it. Ellsworth doesn't have a tail, which is totally cute, but it is also helpful in keeping him clean - he is so accommodating! He was also born with a short rear leg that gives him the gait of a hopping bunny. None of this stops him from his quest of being a cute, playful and loving kitty. Ellsworth would do well in any home with a caretaker committed to his special needs. Do you have room in your heart for boy? All APA! kittens are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

106,"Affectionate, Gentle, Lap Cat We might not be the most objective, but we think Hayden is the most handsomest cat on the planet! He is always dressed to the nines in a tasteful gray tux. But it's not all about his looks - he's a well-mannered gentleman. He uses the litter box like a gent, and he minds the furniture as well. Hayden loves being around people because 1) they have a lap, and 2) they give pets! In his world, head scratches are the best. (Or maybe belly rubs are the best. Hmmm, more research required...!) He will step over your tummy or laptop, if you're working, to get your attention. But he is super sweet and not pushy about it. And no matter how much you want to pet him, he can take it; bring on the petting! He's an affectionate and distinguished cuddler, and if he could talk, he'd probably recite a bit of Shelley or Byron while lounging in your lap. He's a classic dude. Hayden has diabetes and requires some extra medical care, which may include regulated diet and/or insulin. For more information, please contact APA! He is splendid about taking his medicine, and will beg for food, which he likes to savor slowly, with periodic sips of water. Similarly, Hayden plays some, but it's like you are recording him in slow motion! He is entertaining to watch - and calming, because it's at a measured pace, not a crazy-kitten pace. We have never seen him anything but mellow, unless the puppy in his foster home insists on bothering him, then Hayden has to put his paw down to such shenanigans. You might not be surprised that Hayden is a Master Sleeper; he has perfected that and indulges in it as often as possible! His ideal home would be with someone who would love him and give him affection. He would do likely be fine with other pets, and even kids. Contact us today to set up a meet and greet! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.

107,"Short, stocky and totally adorable, Sparky is a loyal and affectionate friend who would love to be the next resident of your household. He's currently living in a foster home and they can attest that he'll make a lucky family very happy when he moves in! Sparky's foster mom says he's one of the most cuddly dogs she's ever known and has the perfect activity level. He enjoys long walks or short jogs, but he doesn't need to be constantly burning off extra energy. He can also entertain himself and he loves to toss his toys in the air and then go track them down. He also enjoys a round of tug of war and kind of playing fetch - Sparky will bring you a toy, you throw it, he will go sit with it for a while, then bring you a different toy, or just throw the toy to himself because why not? Feel free to try to teach him the rest of the rules of the game! Sparky also has excellent manners in the home. He's house and crate-trained but does great left alone outside of one and hasn't show any destructive tendencies. But he really prefers having his favorite people around, even if he's just chilling nearby while they work. Sparky takes some time to warm up to new people, but once he trusts you, he's as loyal and kind as can be. He's very affectionate and loves to curl up with his favorite humans and definitely thinks he's a lap dog. He loves to lay his head in his person's lap while they stroke his head or just snuggle on the bed or couch. If there's only a tiny little space there for him, Sparky says he can make it work! He also walks well on leash and knows 'sit' and 'come'. Sparky will make a fantastic companion to the right family. Come meet him and see if this big cuddlebug is right for yours! 10/27/18 5:24 AM"
108,"You know how people say 'There's one in every family?' That quirky uncle or strange cousin who is very particular about tiny details or has very strong opinions on any number of obscure topics? Mickey is that one. He's a bit of an oddball. But like that crazy uncle, he will give you a lifetime of great stories to tell. What is so odd about Mickey? For one, he has fallen in love with a bit of red felt that was pulled off of another toy. Not the toy. Just this little scrap of red felt. It is his precious. He cuddles with it. Wrestles with it. Just the piece of red felt. His second favorite game is to steal the bones of the bigger dogs he lives with and hide them under the TV. Same spot, every time. This is the height of hilarity for Mickey. It takes time for Mickey to warm up to people, but once you enter his circle of trust, he really comes to depend on you. He loves to cuddle (on his terms), follow you around, and be near you. Any person, thing or experience that is not you will be greeted with anxiety and suspicion. If you're around to assure him things are OK, then he settles quickly. Mickey thrives on routine. The more he can predict what will happen, the happier he will be. He is house-trained, knows sit, come, no and 'bed time.' He probably would love to learn any number of commands. The more he understands, the less surprises in store. He is pretty good on a leash, and about medium energy for his size. He loves a good play session but is mostly content to lounge and sunbathe. His perfect home would be one with another dog to keep him company when the humans are away. Preferably another dog with a high tolerance for antics. Mickey is not a dog that will fall instantly in love with you. It will take time and patience to build that bond. But you will be rewarded for that patience with a fun and funny guy with endless loyalty, love and great stories to tell. Mickey is an adventure. If he sounds like one worth taking, come meet him! 10/27/18 5:24 AM"
109,"Rufus is like that goofy friend of yours who is always cracking you up and whose zest for life is contagious! Rufus is happy doing just about anything - whether that's zooming around the yard, chasing tennis balls, or lounging in mud puddles like the cutest little hippo you've ever seen. Once he gets a few zoomies out of the way, he's ready to lounge around and watch a Netflix marathon. But no matter what he's doing, he's doing it with a huge grin and a huge tongue hanging out! His big smile and his wiggly butt are hard to resist. Rufus walks great on leash. He will happily hang out in his crate, but most of the time he doesn't need it - he stays home alone loose in the apartment while his foster parents are at work. He doesn't get on the furniture and has learned to stay out of certain areas of the house, like the kitchen. He loves attention and is especially fond of men. Very laid back and affectionate, Rufus loves to lay close by his people and gently remind them that they should be scratching his belly. But he also enjoys his alone time and will lounge on his bed or look out the window quietly while his people do things around the house. He's so happy to see his people every time they come home, he can't help doing a couple zoomies before rolling over for belly rubs. His quirks include laying with his feet sticking straight out behind him from under his chubby rear end and he often has very exciting dreams and makes adorable little barking and howling noises. APA!'s favorite little hippo lives big and loves big. We can't wait for him to get into a home where his big love is reciprocated and where he gets all the snuggling he can handle. Come meet this goofy charmer today! 10/27/18 5:24 AM"
110,"Sweet, cuddly, quiet If ever there was a kitty that could use the warmth, patience and understanding of a loving home, it's this 7-year-old sweetie-pie named Coco. When Coco first arrived at APA! she not only had arthritis and a congenital bone deformity in her front feet, she was thin enough to need some extra nutrition as well. So in addition to pain meds for her arthritis, Coco also requires a special prescription diet of both wet and dry food to keep her gaining weight and improving her overall health. And so far, so good. Yet even with all that stacked against her, Coco has proven herself to be the sweetest, most mellow and affectionate companion anyone could wish for. After just a few weeks of shyness with her current foster, her comfort and confidence level has risen dramatically. Sure, Coco's oddly shaped front feet slow her down a bit compared to other kitties, but it sure doesn't keep her from zipping to her food dish at mealtime! (Guess she likes that special diet.) She needs help getting up onto the bed she likes to cuddle on, but she can jump down just fine. And not being a staircase-bounder-upper gives her that much more time for some of her favorite things: making biscuits on a nice, soft blanket; napping like an orange fluff ball in her cat bed; sitting and/or sleeping next to her favorite humans; being held like a baby and having her head and ears rubbed...and rubbed...and, oh yes, let's rub them some more! Because Coco was once bullied by another cat, we recommend that her adoptive home be feline-free, with maybe a small, boundary observing dog as a four-legged friend. As for children, the older and gentler variety would be best. Finally, to that one special family reading this right now, we can say with certainty that your willingness to welcome a kitty like Coco into your home will be repaid many times over in warm and loving companionship All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information, or to meet Coco, please email adopt@austinpetsalive.org. 10/27/18 5:24 AM"
111,"Zany, Entertaining, Master Biscuit Maker Macadamia may be a little old lady on the outside, but she is a fierce kitten at heart! Her sense of adventure is ever-present, and Macadamia loves to scope out every inch of the room she is in. This is her favorite way to play and use the space provided to her! Her unique and friendly personality more than makes up for her tiny stature. Macadamia has a lot of love to give, and will especially welcome her human's company. She will reward your presence with ample biscuits! Extra affection will come your way if you provide a lap or spot next to you for her to sit while giving her chin scratches! She will make a point to be underfoot, so be ready to stay on your toes! Just don't attempt to pick her up, that may be the only time she uses her voice in protest. Macadamia would love a forever home full of scratching pads and hidey hole beds (her favorite!) and she will never say no to a treat. She has been around other cats and kittens her whole time at APA! and while she is not quite playful, she can certainly get along with most everyone! She may need to remind other kitties with a quick paw that though she is small, she is not one to be messed with! She has not met any kids, but could potentially do well with older, respectful children. Same goes for dogs, though she may try and boss them around! Macadamia's spirit has never dwindled! She is still as curious as ever. Her walk may be wobbly at times, but it hasn't gotten in the way of any of her adventures! She may occasionally miss the litterbox, but she is on some medication for urinary problems, and doesn't make it difficult to administer them! Macadamia is looking for a home filled with love (and food!), and is excited to start breaking in all her forever human's cushions with her master biscuit making skills! Macadamia is FeLV+ (Feline Leukemia Virus), which causes a weakened immune system and requires special care. APA! provides some medical assistance after adoption. Cats with FeLV typically have a shortened lifespan. Macadamia is not contagious to people or dogs, but should live only with other FeLV+ cats.

112,"This handsome tall drink of water is Rio! His interests include fetch, swimming, fetch, treats, fetch, and gently leaning into your leg for pets. We should also mention that he loves playing fetch and will regularly do leaps and flips in the air trying to catch the ball. And he's really great at bringing the ball back to you and dropping it. If he thinks you don't see the ball on the ground, he'll politely pick it up and set it in your lap. Rio manages to keep the game going with even the laziest of tennis ball throwers! True to his name, Rio also really LOVES being in the water! Whether you're hosing him off or taking him for a dip in a pool or creek, he'll take all the water time he can get. And while he is incredibly energetic when playing with a ball or in the water, when he's all tuckered out, he's happy to hang out with his person and snuggling. Rio can be aloof with people he doesn't know, but he warms up quickly and before long he's asking for belly rubs and cuddles. Rio's a big guy, but he is very easy to walk on leash and enjoys going a nice quiet walk around the neighborhood, taking in all the sights and smells while staying by your side at a nice pace. He's also a smart pup who sits politely for treats and recently became TOP Dog Ready, which means he has already learned all the skills in his training plan in APA!'s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Rio has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Dogs in the program learn skills including sitting calmly when approached by strangers, calmly walking past another dog, staying in a sit or down until told 'free,' and coming when called. In addition, Rio has also learned 'Place'. Rio has worked hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Rio after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Rio's an easy friend who's easy to please and he's more than ready to move on to his forever home.

113,"Tito is a very friendly little guy who gets along famously with just about anybody! He is good with other dogs, but especially likes lady dogs. And don't let this sweet boy fool you. While he does tend to be a more low key and naps-on-the-couch kind of guy, he likes to play with his foster sisters and enthusiastically takes up a regular patrol around the fenced back yard. Tito is a real goofball and will make you laugh with his silly antics and seems to go out of his way to brighten up your day. His mind is always going going going and you can tell he is very aware of his surroundings and likes to check everything out. Tito freely gives his love to everyone, but especially to those he bonds with and he's a real snuggle bug. Everything he does is cute, from the way he curls up in his bed to the way he gently paws at his face when he's sleepy to the little barks he uses to talk with you. His favorite thing - other than food - is his curling up in his bed and blanket and he is totally fine with sharing. He does tend to get overly excited about treats, but he has not shown any resource guarding behavior regarding food and he understands gently taking them from the palm of your hand. All of the dogs in the home are fed separately and Tito goes right to his spot for meals. Tito has congestive heart failure, so he does require daily medications along with frequent potty breaks. It's hard to believe he has any medical issues with his outgoing and lively personality. A home with access to a yard and some napping space is all Tito needs to thrive. But don't take our word for it, go visit Tito in his foster home and fall in love with him today! 10/27/18 5:24 AM"

Exploring with him is easy; he's great on a leash, responds when called and enjoys carrying supplies for the team.

He is constantly rolling on the ground for belly rubs, especially if he can you think he's been a good boy about something - he rolls right over to get his reward. And you'd be doing that a lot because he IS a good boy. Whiskey is really smart and has a lot of skills under his belt - sit, down, place, come - he knows them all! Whiskey is also house-trained and does well in his crate. When out of the crate, he knows what toys he can play with and what things are off limits. Though he loves a good romp or a game of fetch, he is equally fond of naps and lounging on the couch. Really, just being with his people is his favorite thing. He's just the most affectionate little love muffin you'll ever meet. Need a partner for outdoor adventures? Whiskey is ready to explore the hidden gems of Austin for hiking and swimming. He really likes to get away from the excitement of Lady Bird Lake to see what else is out there. He's also game for a good game of fetch as long as every adventure ends with a nice long nap on the couch, snuggled next to his number one buddy. With his smoky brown eyes, he looks up to you for guidance in every situation. With a subtle cue from you, he'll show you all his skills. This sweet boy will keep you balanced - lots of one-on-one time snuggling on the couch and a fond farewell when you go out to visit with friends.

Or finding joy in a tennis ball flying through the air? Chubbs will show you how to love life for the little things. He adores chasing balls, then settling down for all kinds of love. Once you've earned his trust, Chubb's fun loving personality really begins to shine. He'll let you rub his speckled belly and rub his soft ears, and he's not above telling you that you are not nearly finished with the belly rubs should you stop too soon! Each and every day, Chubbs finds something else to enjoy. Maybe it's learning a new trick like place or a new tree he's never sniffed before but he teaches us to always stop and find the joy. If you want to find the way to Chubb's heart, it's definitely through his stomach. He'll roll out his whole bag of tricks for a delicious treat. First a sit where his little bottom starts wiggling.

If you're standing, she'll rub around your ankles and purr to ask for pets. If you're sitting at your desk, she'll lie at your feet or sit on your desk next to you, perhaps gently nudging your hand with her head. And if you're lounging on the couch or in bed, she'll purr her delight non-stop as she snuggles next to you. Love isn't a one-way street with this girl. One of the most amazing things about Leslie is that she can tell if you're sad or stressed, and if you are, she'll be right there with you to purr and cuddle your sadness away! She loves you so much that sometimes she'll gently take your finger or hand in her mouth as if she's literally trying to taste you! But don't worry, she won't bite you - she had a history of dental problems, which required that she have teeth extracted. She feels soooo much better now! Leslie enjoys gazing out the window and strolling around her home to explore her surroundings and find sweet napping and hiding spots. She rarely runs or leaps around, and she isn't really interested in toys. They're nowhere near as interesting as you are! She is talkative, and will let you know if she's hungry or in need of snuggles. Leslie's ideal home would be one where someone is around more often than not to give her all the love and attention she craves. In return, she'll shower you with love and soothe you whenever you're sad or stressed. All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Leslie, please email us at adopt@austinpetsalive.org. 10/27/18 5:24 AM"
124,"Kit is a very distinguished gentleman. He has a regal look to him, but not so regal that he doesn't appreciate a good butt scratch! Kit is so overjoyed by a good butt scratch that he folds himself up into a fat furry donut of love and happiness when he gets them. Belly rubs too. It's not uncommon to look over and see Kit sitting nearby with a big smile on his face, waiting for you to give him some. This handsome guy is a huge fan of people and will follow you around the house and nudge you with his nose to let you know it's time for pets if it's been a while. And as long as Kit gets a healthy dose of affection, he's generally happy to lay by your feet while you work or watch tv. Kit really loves walking around with tennis balls in his mouth, and he'll even carefully select one out before he goes for a walk: 'Hmm, what are we in the mood for today, old chap? Perhaps a Penn 100? Smells like it was a good year.' Kit's also a pretty low maintenance pup to have around. He has wonderful manners in the home, he's house-trained and will tell you when he needs to go out. He walks great on leash as long as you keep an eye out for squirrels (this boy gets very excited about those darn squirrels), he knows 'sit' and is perfectly well-behaved when left home alone. Kit's one of those dogs who can't help but bring a smile to your face. And who doesn't need more of that in their life? Come meet this great pup! 10/27/18 5:24 AM"
125,"Tranquil, Senior, Gorgeous Ginger has the most beautiful tortie coloring. She's a calm, smart girl who is independent and moderately active. Ginger was tolerant of kids, cats and dogs during the twelve years she spent in her original home. After being surrendered due to her owner moving, Ginger spent some time with other animals and didn't enjoy their company in the least. For this reason, we think a home with no other pets would be best for this senior gal. A household with adults only or that includes older children, rather than younger, would be ideal. Before her stay with APA!, Ginger had been declawed. As a result of this she must remain an indoor cat. A cozy bed, some nice scratches behind the ears and love in a forever home would make Ginger's golden years exactly as she imagined. If you're just the one to make her dreams come true, contact us to meet Ginger today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Ginger, please email adopt@austinpetsalive.org. 10/27/18 5:24 AM"
126,"Pretty, Affectionate, Independent Rainy is an attractive senior lady who still enjoys a go-round with a feather toy now and then. Being the independent, confident type she prefers to be the star of the show and not share the limelight with other kitties. She's in search of a home where she is the top cat and the only one, and is more than ready to settle in with a family of her own. Her wish list includes petting sessions, kindness and scrumptious treats. In return she offers love, companionship and the ability to make each day brighter! If you're interested in your very own furry superstar, Rainy is ready to shine! Come by and meet this black and white lovely today! All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team. For further information or to meet Rainy, please email us at adopt@austinpetsalive.org. 10/27/18 5:24 AM"
127,"We don't know much about Lady Red's past, but we are certain that her future is sunny, with a 100% chance of a forever family! Lady Red currently resides in a very special and loving foster home, where she has proven over and over how perfect she is. A low maintenance gal, she is house and crate-trained and she loves nothing more than to meet and greet new people. With her striking beauty and soft manners, she'd be a good addition to most families. Lady Red's favorite activities are playing with toys, car rides and napping under the sun. She absolutely loves the feeling of soft wind and the shiny sun on her sweet face, and she can often be seen around town walking and exploring with her foster family. She has good leash manners and is learning basic commands. Just like us humans, our beautiful Lady comes with some quirks. She is partially blind, possibly due to having Canine Diabetes, which is managed by diet and insulin shots (watch her video - we promise it's really easy). This beauty is so intuitive that it took her no time to memorize her foster home's layout and breezes around the furniture with no problems. As you watch her navigate her environment, you'd swear she had no sight issues at all. Lady Red has come a long way to find her place in this world. If you'd like to walk this earth right next to her, don't delay! 10/27/18 5:24 AM"
128,"Poppy Seed, like her name suggests, is just an adorable little muffin waiting for someone to scoop her up. This girl's sparkly eyes and big smile light up every room she walks into. She brightens the mood of everyone that sees her, and she will brighten your mood too! Poppy Seed's two favorite things are food and toys. She likes to carry a toy around on her walks at the shelter - as if she needed to be any more adorable! She's also learning that when she sits or gives eye contact, she gets more treats, so she now does them without being asked. It's hard to say no to that face, so we keep the treats coming. Poppy Seed has spent some time in a home and seems to be housebroken. She's a happy girl who just needs some toys to play with, and she'll stay entertained. Poppy is also in the Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Poppy Seed has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help her learn the skills to become the best dog she can be! She is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told 'free,' and coming when called. Once Poppy Seed successfully completes all the skills on her training plan she will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Poppy Seed is working hard to become a wonderful pet and as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Poppy Seed after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https://vimeo.com/89434193 Come meet this spunky sweetheart today! 10/27/18 5:24 AM"

Ricky is hands down one of the best Great Danes we have had the pleasure to help. He was found as a stray, skin and bones and covered in ticks. This guy so did not deserve to live like that. Ricky does not have a mean bone in his body and loves everyone he meets! He did test positive for heartworms which did not really surprise us considering the way he had been living. He has already been started on the slow kill and everything needed to complete the treatment is included with his adoption.
Ricky is neutered, has had a gastropexy, current on all vaccinations, microchipped, and just had a dental. If you are interested in this wonderful guy, his adoption fee is $300 and an online application can be completed at www.texasgreatdane.org.

This guy is Lennox he is an 18 month old neutered male doberman who found himself on the auth list down in the valley. Most everyone was uninterested because of the very large open wound running down his back. Commonly this is caused by using cheap flea and tick meds which creates a chemical burn. We've gotten him all healed up from this, however he will always carry the scar of it. He is a happy fun loving boy who gets along great with everyone and seems super intelligent and food motivated.

You must also be committed to housebreaking, age-appropiate enrichment and exercise, leash training, grooming needs, and positive socialization.

His adoption fee is $150. This includes his neuter surgery, rabies vaccination, DhPPv vaccination, deworming, tested negative for heartworms, one month of flea and heartworm preventative, microchip, leash and collar, Petco coupon book, and 30-days of pet health insurance.

Meet our beautiful Baylee!

Baylee is a 1-year-old Basset Hound.

Baylee was saved from a south Texas shelter where she was scheduled to be euthanized.

Baylee is one of the happiest and friendliest dogs on the planet! She rapidly learned how to play with other dogs, how to use the doggie door, and we have started working on her sit command. She would make a wonderful addition to any family!

You must also be committed to housebreaking, age-appropiate enrichment and exercise, leash training, grooming needs, and positive socialization. Like most young dogs, she will chew on anything within her reach to include but not limited to baseboards, shoes, socks, children's toys, electrical cords, etc.
Her adoption fee is $300. This includes her spay surgery, DhPPv vaccination, bordetella vaccination, rabies vaccination, deworming, one month of flea and heartworm preventative, microchip, leash and collar, Petco coupon book, and 30-days of pet health insurance.

Meet our precious Sienna!
Sienna is a 1-year-old Terrier blend and weighs 17 pounds.
Sienna and her sister Sierra were surrendered to a kill shelter because their owner could no longer care for them.
Sienna is initially shy but quickly warms up when offered treats and affection. She is sensitive to correction and will retreat under the bed but will reappear once she realizes she will not be harmed. Despite her prior neglect, Sierra is very playful and affectionate! She is highly intelligent and a quick learner. She loves other dogs and her ideal home would have other friendly and playful dogs. Sienna can be an escape artist so she should never be left unattended while outside.
Please understand you are commiting to providing a good home for her entire life (up to 15+ years or more).
You must also be committed to housebreaking, age-appropiate enrichment and exercise, leash training, grooming needs, and positive socialization. Like most young dogs, she will chew on anything within her reach to include but not limited to baseboards, shoes, socks, children's toys, electrical cords, etc. She is crate-trained and housebreaking is progressing nicely.
Her adoption fee is $150. This includes her spay surgery, DhPPv vaccination, bordetella vaccination, rabies vaccination, deworming, one month of flea and heartworm preventative, microchip, leash and collar, Petco coupon book, and 30-days of pet health insurance.

138,"FOSTERS NEEDED IN AUSTIN. HOUND RESCUE is trying to increase its foster network to try to help save beagles' and bigger hounds'  live's in the Austin area. Can you help us by opening your heart and home to a needy dog? Fostering is a great way to get some puppy love without having to commit to 15 years! Or - it's a wonderful way to become familiar with breeds and, who knows, maybe you'll find the dog of your dreams to adopt? Sometimes a good foster family is the only thing standing between being a pup and being a pup put to sleep. If you can help, contact Amy by e-mail at amy@houndrescue.com. Together we can save a life!!!

139,"Hound Rescue is urgently looking for an adult-only home with dog experience and no other pets to foster or adopt Sam.

Sam is a gorgeous young dog, very striking - he was a big hit at Dogtoberfest last fall. We believe his breed to be Colombian fino hound, possibly a mix. Sam looks like a beagle-basset mix, only 3 times as large as a typical beagle! He is very friendly and good-natured and absolutely loves his people. However, Sam strongly needs training, structure and routine and cannot live in a home with other dogs. Sam would be best in a home with no cats.

Sam is very strong and still has a lot of young dog energy, so needs lots of outlets for that energy, especially considering his size. He should not be in a home with young children, as he can be overwhelming with them. He needs an experienced dog owner who can handle a strong and energetic dog and commit to a structured training program and routine. Hound Rescue will cover the cost of training for a committed owner willing to work with him.

Sam will reward the right owner with all his exuberance and love!

140,"Stacey is a Treeing walker / foxhound mix with beautiful brown eyes that will melt your heart. Stacey is very energetic and smart, she likes to learn if you are smart enough to teach her! She loves to work for food that is of high value. She loves to play and run â if you need a running partner, Stacey is your girl! She communicates very well if you can learn her âlanguage.â Stacey likes to stay occupied with chew toys and these are a regular part of her routine, otherwise she can get bored easily. She tends to snore when she is asleep.

Stacey knows how to sit, stay, touch, play dead and give both paws. She loves the outdoors and thrives in a structured environment. She is probably the first dog ever weâve placed who has passed her Canine Good Citizen test, but as always she will need to keep up with her training. To keep Staceyâs behavior well-mannered, she needs to earn or work for whatever she wants. Stacey will do better with older children.

Her foster mom referred to her as a Velcro dog; she wants to snuggle right next to you and doesnât like to let you out her sight. Sheâs very social, always wants to meet other dogs and people. Bailey has started to enjoy playing with toys in her foster home. She gets along with the other dog in her foster home, but doesnât play with him very much. She can be possessive of food and treats around other dogs. Bailey suffers from some skin allergies, but her condition has improved with baths and meds. She is housebroken and uses a doggy door. She isnât fond of the crate, but will go in if enticed with treats.

She loves a good snuggle and rub but also likes time alone on a soft couch, rug, or in the kennel. She will do zoomies in the yard and play chase with the pack. She loves a good sunning, too!

It seems Shelly had hard life. She can be shy, timid and even scared by sudden movements or loud voices. She is slowly learning that people mean love.

She is housebroken and picks up quickly on new commands. Shelly has this sweet little slow wag to her tail and the best dinner dance youâve ever seen! Will Shelly be your next dance partner?

155,"Scarlet Rogue absolutely loves her toys; balls, tugs, stuffed or squeaky and they are especially appealing when a human wants the toy too. This 6 year old lady loves to play with toys and people. Scarlet is blind, but she is otherwise healthy and heartworm negative. She is an energetic flashy fawn lady.

Scarlet Rogue is house, crate and leash trained; she needs access to a dog door and a handler that recognizes when her visual impairment makes her stop on a walk. Calm reassurance gets her started again. She has become friends with all 5 of her furry foster friends (except the Jack Russell doesnât know it yet) and especially likes to play with the Schnauzer mix. She has not chased the cats she has met but that may be due to her sight issues. She has been good with children, but just as with our deaf dogs who can be unwittingly startled, she cannot be placed with children under 10.

This pretty, healthy, happy lady is all Boxer. Sure, she has a glitch, but that hasnât stopped her from loving people and toys and dogs and being a terrific buddy. Sheâll reward your patience with wiggles and snuggles and offer you her toy. Scarlet is a Permanent Foster with no adoption fee who will receive support similar to one of ABRâs Silverhearts."
156,"Benny Pointer was named by one of our volunteers to honor a very special Boxer who succumbed to cancer and left a beautiful story about him and his owner. This fellow is 7 to 8 years old and will be 90 to 100 pounds when he fills out again. You would not know this fawn boyâs age by watching him move and play. He loves to run and be with his people. Heâs probably too big for a family with kids because he so big and goofy. He is healthy and heartworm negative so heâs ready to run today.

Benny is crate trained, house trained and leash trained. He knows sit, down and stay. He gets along fine with all the dogs heâs met and currently lives with several Boxers from old to puppy. Bennyâs best friend is Hickory They hang out together and sleep in an open kennel together during the day. He has not been destructive in the house and follows direction well. Benny thrives with structure. He loves water and will stand under the hose on a hot day. This guy would actually do OK in an apartment with an active person or couple, or with a fur buddy or two, so long as there are clear, consistent boundaries.
"
157,"If ever there was a name with a perfect fit, itâs got to be Hickory. Olâ Hickoryâ¦ Just look at that face and you can see so many adventures and memories. Olâ Hickory is around 6 or 7 years old; young enough to keep you company and old enough to stay by you. His beautiful fawn coat and just-beginning-to-gray muzzle are distinguished. Heâs a healthy boy although he is heartworm positive. As always, ABR will work with his adoptive family for treatment.

Hickoryâs best friend is Benny Pointer. The live in a house full of Boxers and get on well with all of them. Hickory is calmer than Beny and they usually takes naps together in an open kennel. He likes to run around the yard and play with the others and Benny. He is terrific with his crate; going in is a breeze and heâs so quiet you could forget him in there. Heâs house trained and not destructive and not really interested in toys. He does fine with kids and would do well with a fur buddy.

This sweet, gentle soul would do fine in most families, and would do well in an apartment with someone who needs a walking companion. Maybe he can share some stories with you.

159,"Tribeca is a little fawn girl who gets along with dogs and kids and maybe cats, depending on the cat. She is heartworm negative and healthy. The slight bend in her foreleg is a birth defect that has no impact on her ability to run and jump, go on walks and play with the other dogs.  Sheâs a happy little girl with a full tail, floppy ears and a face that asks âwhatâs next?â

This 5 year old cutie loves to go on walks and calms down after a  block or so. She is house and crate trained too. Her skin kids like to play fetch with her even though sheâs a little short on the return end. Tribeca is sweet with a mellow energy level; sheâs ready to join you but she can wait until youâre ready. Tribeca will make a great companion for some lucky family."
160,"Silverheart pair with Ellie Fredricksen

Carl and Ellie Fredrickson are an older couple looking for a retirement home. It can be a â55 and olderâ community with other more spry residents as they (Carl especially) donât act their age. Carl is about 10 and Ellieâs about 13 and of course they are Silverhearts. Ellie doesnât get out and dance as she once did, but she still gets around. She and Carl, their foster mom and grandma and all the other big and small dogs like to sit out back and enjoy the sunsets together.

They get along fine with big and small dogs and cats too. There arenât any small kids in this menagerie so weâre not sure how they do with kids. Both of them have been dieting because foster mom said so, and they are feeling much better. Carl and Ellie are real sweethearts who would love to fill your home with warmth and laughter and smiles and a few sunsets while they can."
161,"This poor, scared little girl is Pepper. Sheâs a tiny little thing who has clearly had a very rough life before ABR. There are so many new things, and learning to trust people is so hard, but she really, really wants to belong. Pepper is pretty submissive and does well with all the dogs in her foster home. She is brand new to rescue and even though thereâs so much for her to comprehend all at once, sheâs doing it well. We will obviously know more about Pepper as she has a chance to decompress and learn about her new life. Looks like sheâll do just fine.

162,"Nilla is an older gal, a beloved Silverheart who has come upon tough times. Her caretaker asked ABR to help her find a family to love her as her prior owner passed away and her caretaker is also elderly. Nilla is about 14 years old and as youâd expect, she gets along with people and dogs well. She does not live with kids but she is gentle and calm at her age.

She walks well on leash and rides quietly in a car. She is affectionate, friendly and obedient and in pretty good health for an older lady. Her fawn coat is growing silver and her face has the graceful silver highlights earned with age. ABR helps support Silverhearts and there is no adoption fee. You can learn more about Silverhearts on their own page. Do you have room in your home and heart for Nilla to love you from now on?

163,"Dodger is an 11 year old guy who lost his home when his dad went to jail. He's a very well loved guy, and very healthy. He arrived fully vetted from the Bell County shelter. His ears are clean, his teeth are in good shape for his age, no bad breath. He has 4 boxer bumps of various sizes, but is robustly healthy otherwise (no stiffness or pain). Roger Dodger is good with small dogs and is curious enough about cats to chase them, but smart enough to back off when they hiss at him. He gets over excited when meeting dogs his size, I think he has never actually had a dog playmate before and he really wants to be friends. I'll work on his social skills with my pack. He knows sit, stay, shake and he corrects very nicely when he gets exuberant on the leash.

165,"Petite, sweet, loving little Mulberry finally has a family that is kind to her and expects her to be part of what they do. No more outside in a kennel, raising pups or anxiously anticipating the next forced breeding. This little fawn sweetheart is only 4 or 5 years old and this world of touches and treats and laps is brand new. She has been fully vetted, spayed and finished the routine preventive medications for dogs like her from the Palm Valley area. Remarkably she is heartworm negative.

Mulberry soaks up love and attention like a sponge. She loves people, even little people, and cuddling is about as good as it gets. Mulberry did not need to develop social skills with dogs or people in the puppy mill, but she is catching up quickly in her foster home. She does not like dominant male dogs (no surprise there) but is learning that some dogs are OK, like the submissive male Boxer she lives with now.

Mulberry is house, crate and leash trained. Her experienced foster mom explains â It is hard not to give in to her soulful brown eyes and pixie face when it is time for discipline but she responds well when told no. She does have a stubborn streak so repetition and patience are key.â This little darling needs a loving family who can say no when needed and still shower her with love, attention, inclusion and security. Goodness knows she earned it.

166,"Princess Margaret is a lady of a certain age (9, but weâre not telling) who gets along with her younger fur friends and 2 little skin kids just fine. That doesnât mean she hasnât earned a bit of respect, like âget the heck out of my quiet spot, NOWâ kind of respect. A glance and a low comment is all thatâs needed for the youngsters to get the message. Itâs quiet time inside after all. Outside, well, she can still run with the best of them; and slow down for play time with the skin kids too.

This lady sports a fawn coat with a white chest and just a dash of white on her neck, pretty elegant. You donât even have to ask if she is house trained, I mean, really how embarrassing. Sheâs fine outside a crate too. When sheâs not napping in her quiet spot youâll find her right by your side. Princess Margaret likes her humans, big and small.

This lady has had a few litters, of course, and she is heartworm positive. ABR will discuss the options for treatment and help with it too. This sweet, dignified lady has some years left in her journey. Sheâd love to have her quiet spot next to you while you read a book, or watch tv, or take a nap with her.

167,"ABR gives each dog a unique name so we can identify them with their microchip should the need arise. Sometimes a dog gets a special name through the Name-A-Boxer program, but for the most part the names are randomly assigned. This 3 to 4 year old guy with a white coat hit the jackpot. His name is Chance, and boy did he need one. He was not well because he had an STD so his only way out of the shelter alive was with a rescue. So, ABR gave him a chance, and the perfect name.

Chance receives his final treatment on 4/24. He is heartworm positive, but ABR always explains the options and assists with treatment; it doesnât have to be difficult now. He lives in a foster home with 2 Boxers, 2 school aged kids, and 2 adults. Lucky boy gets to play and help wake the kids for school. He has not had any accidents in the house and he is crate and leash trained too.

Chance is a very sweet, loving boy with good manners. His current idea of fetch stops short of returning the ball,  but he loves to cuddle and be near. Now, he needs just one more chance to win your heart and warm your home. And now, 4/24, Chance is free and clear of the STD!

Sheâs an average size female with a lot of spunk for her age. Sheâs a very submissive girl who lives with small dogs well, but is intimidated and picked on by large dogs. She is a velcro dog who wants to be near her people all the time. She is very people friendly.

Jewelz is house and leash trained but doesnât do well in her crate for more than 3 hours or so, but sheâs not destructive in the house. She loves to sleep on her bed on the floor next to her people. Sheâs healthy and happy, but sometimes situations change. So, once an ABR dog, always and ABR dog. She is about as family ready as they get.

170,"This was part of Roxiâs bio before she was adopted from ABR and subsequently found wandering around  by a good samaritan who had her microchip read and contacted ABR. Attempts to contact the family failed so we still do not know why she was left alone, again. âMost of those rescued by ABR tell their story with their physical and emotional scars, with their fear, with their injuries and sickness, and with their hope; the eternal Boxer hope. Roxi doesnât have scars or injuries, she is not emaciated, she is not fearful, if she has emotional scars she hides them very well. She has hope, and love, and an eagerness to be part of the pack, part of the family, to belong again. Roxi is a very young 7 or 8, youâd guess 4 or 5, with a soft-as-silk fawn coat with white flash in all the right spots to highlight her happy eyes and incessant nub wagging.â  

Roxi came back to ABR and is in a foster home with an older male Boxer and grandkids she adores. Roxi is still gentle, trusting and eager to share as many kisses as possible.
Roxiâs current foster family, her previous ABR foster family, and the staff where she boarded waiting for a foster home have had no difficulty with Roxi at all and all adore her. Through all this she still has a positive, upbeat, wigglebutt demeanor. She doesnât like every dog she meets, but she likes most of them. 

Roxi is heartworm negative and very healthy and on the smaller side for a female. Roxi does not get on furniture unless invited. She loves her walks but is not comfortable in confined spaces with dogs she does not know. She doesnât live with kids but sees her grandkids all the time and is very gentle and loving with them. She would likely do best as an adored only dog or with a fur buddy as she is now. This beautiful older lady is eagerly awaiting her new forever family. ABR will be quite cautious about Roxiâs placement to ensure she is not left alone again.

171,"Someone once described a dog as a âFamily Dog in a Boxâ. That description fits Cecily to a T. She is a beautiful 6 year old with patience and grace. She plays with one of her host dogs and politely lets him know when sheâs done. Her other host dog doesnât like other dogs much and she respects his distance. The cats still refuse to play and she lets them slide. She is very loving and patient with the toddler and early schooler in her home too.

Cecily curls up in her crate for a nap or quiet time whenever sheâs ready. She loves laying in the sun, walks, and being near her people and she has great recall. Cecily is eager to please and learn new things. 

Cecily is a very well balanced lady who is easy to live with. She is heartworm positive and not symptomatic. ABR will explain treatment options and help with it; treatment need not be difficult now. She is otherwise healthy, happy and steady. You will wonder where sheâs been all this time when you see her napping in her crate in your home.

Ace is great with children and other dogs! He is housebroken, kennel trained and listens very well to commands. He is a big boy, so if you LOVE big dogs...ACE is the one! He will do best in a home that will give him structure and adequate exercise. He loves to play and go for walks, but also just hang out like a couch potato with his humans. Ace would truly be amazing for any family as he is one of the best dogs you could ever meet. If interested in Ace please email Brave Bully Rescue at info@bravebullyrescue.org

Someone said that because sheâs blind if you spook her sheâs going to whip her head around, and although itâs possible, not once did she do that during her stay.
The only work that Iâve ever had to do with her is help her down the stair to go outside and help her find the water bucket. Other then that she will easily take a pill pocket or cheese for her medicine and eat all her food. But if you have other dogs I would recommend waiting around because there were a few occasions when they would decide to help her.
She get along pretty well with other dogs but be mindful they might not appreciate the occasional bump when sheâs up and wandering around.
She loves kittyâs and just wants to give them lots of kisses and will get easily distracted by them.
She will find the spot people spend the most time, like a couch for something, and that will become her favorite spot. She can and will get lonely sometimes but also really enjoys the quiet times and a good scratch.
Hailey I think would be a good and wonderful fit for any house, kids or otherwise, as long as you can understand that she is blind and does need help sometimes. You must be patient with her and she will be patient with you.
Oh. And if you can handle snoring.
Because she does, in fact, snore.

174,"There are times when want-to and can-do just donât match. Such is the case with our little Munchkin. She was adopted in 2015 as a puppy and has lived a pretty happy, easy life. But sometimes declining health or dear relatives who need increasing care just overwhelm the can-do and the beloved Boxerâs welfare has to be addressed. You see, Munchkin likes to explore, and when a gate is accidentally left open, well, heaven knows sheâs going to see whatâs beyond. But she doesnât understand cars and roads and mean people, and that brings us back to what is best for her.

She is small at about 45 pounds, with a docked tail, natural ears, a fawn coat, black mask and white chest. She gets along with dogs just fine but is pretty shy overall and very timid with men. Sheâs between 3 and 4 years old now and completely up to date on her vaccinations, including rattlesnake (it needs an annual booster), heartworm medication and flea and tick meds. She is house, crate and leash trained and does not jump up or get on furniture.

Munchkin is still a bit high energy girl with a high  prey drive: no cats, but she is sweet and cuddly too. It is never easy to let go of a loved one, but sometimes doing what is best for them is the right thing to do. Our Munchkin needs a family where she can be safe and secure.

175,"Penny Lane was named through ABRâs Name-A-Boxer program to honor a dear friend, a very fitting tribute for a dog loving friend. This little bundle of fawn energy is about 2, maybe 3 years old but still acts like a puppy. At about 40 pounds sheâs tiny for a female and even though her broken front leg never healed quite right, sheâs game for whatever comes her way. 

Penny Lane lives with a couple older kids and regularly entertains her neighbor preschooler. She is dog friendly but needs a little time to get to know them first. She is good with her host male Boxer but we donât know how she is with cats. Once she knows her fur buddies itâs playtime! Penny Lane is house, crate and leash trained and short walks are fine but she tires on longer walks.

Penny Lane is a kisser once she gets to know you and be sure sheâs safe. She is heartworm positive but routine medication can take care of that and ABR will help with treatment. She loves her people, her dog buddy, her toys and Boxer burns. So, let her add some joy and smiles to your family. Itâll only take a few minutes and sheâll be showering you with kisses.

176,"Here we have a gorgeous brindle boy with white socks, white bib and a splash on his neck. He has natural ears, a bobbed tail, is heartworm negative and weighs about 65 pounds.. Grande Mocha is just 5 years old.
Grande Mochaâs foster mom says: Grande came in from Rio Grande city in bad shape, walking on 3 of his legs. X-rays show that he had a fractured pelvis that had healed, but the femur that fits back into the pelvis did not set right causing him to be lame. He also has a pellet from a gun shot lodged in the bone. He was emaciated, covered in ticks and had worms. Grande Mocha is all cleaned up, happy to have regular meals, and happy to have 2 Boxer buddies, a family and a soft bed. He spent the weekend at a friends with cats and just ignored them.
This guy is resilient, and goofy, and affectionate. Heâs a low key, low energy guy who loves pets and attention and a safe, soft spot to watch his world from. He is house and crate trained.
UPDATE 9/20/2018:  Life just keeps getting better for Grande Mocha every day. He has had surgery on his hip, and his prognosis is quite a bit more promising now. He had a hip replacement for dogs, a femoral head osteotomy. He will rehab slowly, cautiously with his foster mom for several months, but once heâs done you will never know he once had to limp. Thanks to ABR, and his loving foster mom, Grande Mocha will be fit as a fiddle for his forever family.
"
177,"This little bit of brindle is new to rescue and just beginning to get her feet under her and be comfortable enough to be herself. Fortunately she has a 2 year old skin kid to read stories to her, pet her and snuggle up all safe and warm. Kya is 5 years old with just a touch of gray on her muzzle. She is heartworm positive, as many rescues are, but treatment need not be difficult with ABRâs help. She is, as all ABR rescues, taking monthly medication to prevent additional heartworms.

Kya lives with 3 other Boxers and a Chiweenie and they all get along. Sheâs still a little hesitant to go into the backyard alone, but her love of a sunbath and a stroll around the yard with the oldest Boxer host help her overcome that.  She loves a good rub and grunts her approval for things she likes. Kya is house trained.

This gentle little girl needs a patient, loving family to help continue her healing. It takes time, structure, love and reassurance to help her learn to trust again so she can blossom into the beautiful, sweet girl she is. Itâs normal for her to be a little cautious as she makes all the adjustments in her new life. Are you ready to guide her in exchange for grunts, snuggles, smiles and loyalty?
"
178,"Pea Pod, an unusual name for an unusual Boxer. This beautiful tiger striped brindle female is about 5 years old and probably managed to get away from her life as a breeder. She is brimming over with curiosity about her new life and new world and eager to explore at any turn. She loves her humans but is not entirely convinced they should be in charge all the time. Sometimes Boxers just have to calculate the odds and take a couple seconds to get a better deal.

Pea Pod is very affectionate with her people, including a middle schooler (who might be her favorite), and she gets on very well with the resident male Boxer too. She is house and crate trained, but that leash is such a distraction from her ability to explore, and she is eager to explore so keeping an eye on her will help her be safe.

Pea Pod is heartworm positive but treatment does not have to be difficult now. ABR will explain the options and help with treatment. She will flop down for belly rubs and chill out by your lap, or go off on a grand adventure. Beautiful, elegant, smart, a little cheeky, loving and inquisitive; just what you were looking for.
"
179,"Luigiâs kind of a complicated guy as dogs go. He has a nice white coat with one brindle ear, one blue eye and one brown eye, and he is âhard of hearingâ or partially deaf. He was part of a bonded pair but his dominant brother retarded his socialization while protecting him, so Luigi is now catching up; pretty rapidly too. He lives with several other Boxers and is learning not to hog all the attention. He is just 4 years old.

Heâs a pretty happy guy overall but sometimes needs a hearing buddy to help him out; thatâs called a hearing aid for dogs and Luigi would do best with a buddy who can hear. He is house and crate trained but needs some training and repetition on leash, a common trait with deaf dogs. Sniffing gets to be more important than following rules sometimes. Luigi is great with his 13 year old skin friend and would likely do OK with other kids who respect his size; heâs a big guy. Cats are a definite no for Luigi.

Luigi is heartworm positive, not symptomatic, and ABR will help with treatment. It does not have to be difficult now. He is otherwise a healthy, high energy boy who is eager to please. He is food motivated and loves to be near his people. He has a way to go to gain confidence and be more independent, but heâs come a very long way along that journey so far. Being the one who helps him the rest of the way could just light up your life, and his."

Bruiser is a ball playing boy who loves to play fetch, which helps to burn off his energy.  He is great on his leash, potty trained and crate trained.  He uses the dog door.

Lily is an 8year old special needs female Yorkie, a very sweet girl who weighs about 8 pounds. She is spayed, microchipped, and current on vaccinations.  Lily did not receive adequate health care earlier in her life. In spite of her lack of care she is currently healthy. 

  An Xray shows an old hip fracture that was never treated and has caused a stiffening in her right rear leg.  Her front left leg is missing some bone (probably congenital) and she cannot use it.  

To add to her physical woes, in the past 8 months she suddenly went blind probably due to a condition called SARDS.  Even with her physical challenges, she learned to move around the house and yard at her new foster home.  She is housetrained but requires assistance to go outside.  She loves hanging out on the couch with her person.  Would you like to be Lily's hero or heroine?  This girl is a survivor but we want to see her safe and secure for the rest of her life.  It's time, she needs a forever home where she can be safe and secure forever.  She is very trusting and gives everyone kisses when she first meets you.

Hello!  My name is Nico.  I'm a Havapoo (Havanese and Poodle)with maybe a bit of something else mixed in.  I am probably about a year old and still very much a puppy. I weigh 13 pounds and am as large as I will get.  I am working on the housetraining thing.  I use the doggy door but I think it is more of a game.  I do very well if I am reminded to go outside.  (Remember I'm still a puppy.)

I am active and would love a home with kids or someone who will give me a good long walk.  I love to snuggle, get ear rubs and chase toys.  I am still learning to return a thrown toy.  I would love a home where I'm an only dog because I want to be the center of attention.  I do get along with other dogs.  I don't have an opinion on kids or cats.  I've not been around either at my current foster home.  I think I would like older kids who want to play with me. 

Nico is afraid of being kenneled. After several attempts to introduce him to a crate we are convinced he has had a pretty bad or traumatic experience in the past. As fearful as he is, we seriously doubt he will overcome his fear but possibly in time he might forget. If crating is important to you, this is not the guy for you. 

My foster mom says I'm really sweet and a love bug.  Is there a place in your home and heart for me?  If you want to meet me, please fill out an application.

Misty is a 1 year old Maltese/Morkie mix with a lot of energy and a happy personality.  She gets along with a number of dogs in her foster family and loves having lots of activity.  Misty came into the rescue suffering from a previous injury to her left back leg.  X-rays revealed the hip was dislocated requiring surgery to fix (FHO - femoral head osteotomy).  Surgery was performed and it was found that her femur was shattered below the femoral head.  She sustained an impact hard enough to shatter the largest bone in her body. The good news is, the injury has not slowed her down one bit.  She did have 2 weeks strict crate rest following surgery and 2 weeks of partial crate rest as she resumed full normal activity and rebuilds muscle.  The surgeon expects a full recovery with no impairment or complication in the future.  It will take a month or two before she completely regains full strength.

This beautiful petite girl is from a litter that was brought to a rural shelter when they were only a couple of weeks old. They were scheduled for immediate euthanasia because of severe ulcers on their eyes. We took them in and saw that they got the specialty care needed to restore and preserve their vision.

Tabbibelle is mostly blind in her right eye but you'd never know it. She is an amazingly resilient kitten and doesn't have any ""special needs"".

204,"MEET HIM SAT. AT PETCO ON GREAT HILLS TRL. 1-5PM

Judson and his two litter brothers were rescued when they were only a few days old. He was the smallest of the litter and has always been the most eager to snuggle. In fact he can be pretty relentless about getting his share of love, and he'll push his whole muzzle into your lips for kisses. He has a loud and constant purr, and actually wakes up purring. He loves to zoom and play, and enjoys every kind of toy you give him. He is obsessed with food- his and yours- and will try to push his way into whatever you're eating, so he will need continued training to break this bad behavior.

Jolly and her brother were were abandoned at about 4 or 5 weeks by their stray mama after being born and raised in someone's backyard. The homeowner took them in and cared for them until connecting with our group. She is a very sweet, healthy girl with perfect indoor manners. She purrs loudly when you kiss her, and when she's feeling snuggly she will suck on her fluffy blanky, Jolly's most distinguishing characteristic is that she has no tail. But what she lacks there, she more than makes up for with her giant ears. She is a little of a spitfire, and she loves to jump and chase things.

207,"Rosie is a sweet 5-year old calico girl.  She loves sunbathing  on her bed by the window--she also appreciates the bird bath and feeder outside and spends hours watching birds eat and fly.  She won't hesitate to visit with other pets and supervises any keyboard activity without being a nuisance.  Being a former feral kitten we socialized, Rosie will take some time to adjust and feel safe in a new home. But once you gain her trust, she is affectionate, with a big purr, and she has a fondness for licking hands. She is great with other cats and dogs. She has perfect litter box habits, has been spayed, tested and vaccinated. She would be a great solo companion or a buddy for another kitty.

209,"Nova is a sweet 2 year old Tuxedo girl with expressive eyes and a gentle nature. She likes to play with toys on her own--especially crinkle balls, but also likes to perch on her kitty condo and watch the birds and squirrels. This girl loves to eat and does a cute ""dinner dance"" while waiting for her wet food. She  is happy to demonstrate her affection with ankle rubs, purrs and by making biscuits with her little paws. She is good with other cats but would be perfectly happy as a low maintenance solo cat. She is great about using her scratching post and has perfect litter box manners, and she lets her foster mom clip her claws without protest. If you want a sweet and quiet kitty she will be perfect for you.

We have been working on socializing her with humans, and she has made great progress with her foster mom but is still shy with new people. She loves to be petted around her neck and has a loud purr. She is in good health and has excellent litter box habits. Zena would do best in a quiet household with one or two adults, as an only cat or with one other young playful cat.

211,"Pippin is a 3-year old brown Tabby male with beautiful tiger stripes and a soft coat. He sits next to my computer or on my lap while I type. Playful, easy going, Pippin is very affectionate and loves human company. He enjoys short brushing sessions and lets me clip his claws easily.  At 12 lbs, he is a large but lean cat. He eats canned and dry food, has perfect litter box manners, and is generally a very sweet kitty. These are my observations after 3 months of having him in my home: Pippin will do best in a quiet home.  He would prefer to have all the attention, so a home without another cat would be best. He would be good company to a person who is looking for a very affectionate, gentle, easy-to-take-to-the-vet cat. Pippin is very sensitive and he will be quite upset at first in his new home. But once he trusts his new environment and his new family, he will bond for life. He gives a lot of affection and requires the same in return. He will sleep with you at night and make biscuits and purr at all hours of the night. In brief, Pippin dreams of meeting that special person who will recognize and appreciate his sensitive, super sweet soul.  He is neutered and up to date on all shots.

Quite affectionate, Fiona wants nothing more than to sit in your lap when you are watching TV or typing on the computer. But she is also active and playful--she gets very excited playing with the feather wand or any kind of ribbon waved in front of her and that she can jump and catch. 
Fiona has the engaging  personality of a cat doing a commercial for cat food on television: she purrs and weaves between your legs while you open that can of food. She is easy-going and we think that she would do well with another cat or gentle dog after proper introduction. She is exceptionally tidy with her litter box and has perfect scratching post habits.

218,"We're not going to pull any punches...Rocky is a lover not a fighter. He was found living in an alley, underweight and afraid. We knew right away the mean streets of Austin were no place for such a gentle, snuggle bunny. It was a unanimous decision...this sweet champ would go no more rounds in that lonely ring. Now he's safe and sound and has been making a spectacular cuddling comeback ever since. He loves to snuggle and to gaze up at you with those sparkling blue eyes. He's in prime form with a silky cream coat tinted to perfection to show it and he loves to play. He doesn't hesitate to tell you what's on his mind...no right jab, instead, the gift of gab! Rocky will go the distance when it comes to winning your heart. But, in all likelihood, it will be all his before you know what hit you!

He is a litter box champion. He is in great health, and has tested negative for feline leukemia and FIV. Rocky has also been vaccinated, microchipped and neutered. The adoption fee is $75. .

219,"Handsome, sensitive and caring are just a few words that describe lovely Leon.  Is he the perfect man or what?!  This gorgeous tabby is super affectionate.  He loves sleeping right next to you and gently nuzzling your face.  He prefers not to be around loud people or strangers.  But, if you're mellow, kind and like to dole out gentle pets, he'll be your friend in no time.  Belly rubs especially make this sweet boy drool, and we're not talking figuratively!

Leon prefers women...not surprising that such a handsome fellow is a true ladies' man.  He gets along beautifully with other cats and dogs when given a proper introduction.  He loves playing with his brothers and is a real pro at hide and seek.  You may find him under rugs, behind shower curtains or cleverly ""concealed"" between the sheets! 

When Leon was a kitten he was very ill.  There were times when his foster did not leave his side, unsure if he would live through the night.  But, he was so brave and fought hard to survive.  In time, his foster nursed him back to health, as you can see by his shiny coat and happy spirit.  Now he stays fit and fabulous by eating a special diet, including lots of fresh water, to keep his tummy feeling good. 

Leon is in this world for a reason.  Could it be this sweet soul was put here to love you?  If you're ready to find out, contact us to meet him today. Leon has been neutered  and has received all of his kitten shots. He tested negative for feline leukemia and FIV.

This is the information that we received from Honey Bear's current foster family:

Honey Bear wandered on to the front doorstep of DogBoy's Dog Ranch - the home of the owners, on a cold night mid January when the temp was down to 18 degrees. It was after midnight, and they tried everything they could think of and this scared girl would NOT come inside. So they piled up blankets and built a wind barrier, and prayed she'd make it overnight. She was still there the next morning, and after a bowl of hot beef stew, she decided that coming inside might be alright. Her microchip was never filled out by her original adopter, but it was traced back to Austin Animal Center. The original adopter said he had given her to the humane society, but they had no record of her. So she's been living at DogBoy's for the past two months and we have all fallen in love with her. She has made friends with one very docile male dog, but otherwise is very picky about her friends. She is probably best as the only dog in a home, but is super sweet with people. She had some cancerous growths which DogBoy's paid to have removed, and she is heartworm negative. Likely around 8-9 years old, she's looking for someone to love her and is a big snuggle bug. Our guess is that she is a boxer/mastiff mix. Help us find a home for this sweet girl!

This is the information that we received from Frida's current owner:

7-yr old spayed female Mountain Cur, 50lbs. Cat OK! She's not a bad dog, just the wrong dog for me. Good placement I think: With someone who's retired or works at home a lot and has some quiet place for walks. Here is a great description from The Happy Puppy site: These curs were bred to work, and if deprived of the opportunity to hunt,(my edit- she's afraid of fireworks - runs and hides) guard, or work around a farm they will grow anxious and bored. When they have a job to do, these dogs are generally happy and obedient. They cope very poorly with isolation and boredom and are best kept as an 'only dog,' as they may view other family pets as competition or intruders. Bright and curious, Mountain Curs make for eager pupils during training. Because they are bred to guard, protect and serve, the Mountain Cur can make a spectacular family dog for the right family. They are also excellent hunting dogs with keen instincts and a tireless work ethic. Because of their high guarding and protective instincts, a Mountain Cur dog is normally reserved around strangers. It can take some time for this dog to bypass that reserve and warm up to newcomers. (end of quote) She's great on walks if you don't walk your dog in a neighborhood or go to parks. You don't have friends over with their dogs- unless you already know that she'll be cool with them; they should meet on neutral ground first. She seems to like large, confident male dogs- no females. No goofy, wiggly dogs - gotta be steady. Only dog is fine. She does like attention, and settles down easy. Children-not much exposure here, you will want to supervise initially. Cat OK, she ignores mine but, is interested in them on walks. Good points: She loves people; and children- when she's met them she's calm, just sniffs then backs away. She won't jump, well rarely, and if she does it's very light. She's a smart girl, knows sit, down, up, off, drop it and wait. She hardly barks and doesn't dig. She's playful when she gets along and can be very sweet. Bad point: She's just unpredictable with other dogs. She runs herd on any other dogs in the yard- and can be aggressive. I need to be able to have other dogs at the house- friends, tenants. She has lived with other dogs, 2 male labs also a female lab mix; it just depends on the dog. She does have a lot of good points. I want her to be happy, and on the whole she's a very good. All shots are up-to-date, microchip, flea & tick. I have all her vet papers. She's been well cared for.

This is the information that we received from Bertie's current owner:

Bertie is a 7-year-old Boxer/Bulldog mix, and is a total sweetheart. She is a bit of a bull in a china cabinet at 85 lbs. Bertie came from a home with 5 children, and has been known to adore them, but due to her rehome she has shown a bit of aggression toward children that don't live in her home. She gets along well with other dogs, but needs a bit of time to adjust to them at first. Her behavior towards cats is unknown. Bertie is trained on the commands to sit, lay down, stay, too far (when off leash and too far away), come, leave it, kennel, bone and dinner. Bertie loves walks, playing ball, her favorite tug of war and riding in the car or golf cart.

This is the information that we received from Penny's current owner:

Penny is a 7-year-old Redtick Coonhound, 70 pounds, and is super sweet. We had a baby last year, and no matter how we keep the two apart... it just doesnât work. We need to rehome Penny, and know many people will love her. Sheâs very loving and a great dog that anyone can see is a very lovely lady.

Penny is okay with kids long as they are older kids. As far as dogs, sheâs never been too fond of other dogs, but we adopted her from a home that had two other dogs (so Iâm not sure what happened there). Not sure about cats... but we have cats that have been in our yard, and she couldn't care less.

This is the information that we received from Eva's current owner:

Eva is a sweet, energetic, young female yellow Labrador. She came to me through a rescue group in California via my sister in Las Vegas. Some of her favorite activities include going on walks, playing endless fetch and going on car rides! She enjoys chewing on her bones, getting chest rubs and earning treats for learning. She is crate-trained, harness-trained and housebroken. She interacts well with adults and older children. Eva has a tendency to show aggression towards other animals, which is why we are looking to re-home her. She would do best in a home with no other animals. During her time with my family, Eva has learned some basic obedience through The Canine Center for Training. She is looking for that special active person or family that is willing to take her to the next level! She is spayed, micro-chipped, current on vaccinations through Austin Vet Care (Dr. Brandes) and is HW-negative.

This is the information that we received from Scout's current owner:

Scout is about 10 months old, and weighs 37 pounds. We got her in March from the Aggieland Humane Society in Bryan, TX. She is smart, curious and full of energy. Unfortunately, dog ownership for us is just not working out. We are not able to provide her the amount of exercise she needs, and have found that a dog in the house just is not right for us. We are hoping to find her a new home where she will get the attention that she deserves.

Letty is a young black female Great Dane.  She is estimated to be about 18-months-old.  She was found as a stray on a rural road between Bridgeport and Perrin. It was obvious that she did not come from a good home.  She did not even know what a collar or leash were, but it did not take her long to learn and become an inside pet.   She is very sweet and like most Great Danes, she loves her humans.  She gets along with other dogs, as well as cats and she is good around kids.

If you are interested in giving Letty a good loving home, please fill out the adoption application on our website."
255,"This little 5 lbs. black & tan female Chihuahua was picked up as a stray.  Nobody came to reclaim her, but that's ok, because whoever had this dog did not take care of her, because she was nor spayed and she is HW pos.   

Tilly got spayed, vaccinated and microchipped.  She is now in a foster home waiting for her forever loving home.

Frida is a 6-year-old blue merle Great Dane. She was rescued from a bad home 3 years ago. Her new owner had her spayed, did gastropexy surgery and had her treated for Heartworms. All was great, but unfortunately, Frida's owner is now facing some difficult financial times and she may be losing her home, so she has no choice but to rehome Frida.

This is what Frida's owner said about her: She is a very sweet loving dog.  Like most Danes, she is a velcro dog who wants to be close to her person.  She loves toys. She attaches herself to other dogs but wants to be a bit alpha. She likes to lay in the sun a bit every day. She walks good on the leash and likes to ride in the car. She loves all people and is good with kids. She is protective of the house but warms up to strangers once they are inside the house. 

If you are looking for a great companion sweet gentle giant, please consider giving Frida a new loving home.

LeeLoo is a 6-years-old harlequin Great Dane.  She is super sweet and loves to cuddle all the time! She also gives the best big, slobbery kisses and loves to lean against you while you pet her. She's a bit of a clown and will definitely make you laugh.  She likes to play rough, so it is best that she is not in a home with smaller dogs.  She likes to chase squeaky balls and she loves chew toys. Sheâll need lots of toys, because she tends to go through them pretty quickly.  She prefers to sleep on the bed with you, but will settle for a nice bed of her own.  
For some reason, LeeLoo doesn't like some men, it seems to be very random. She also doesn't like most darker completed people that she has met and she is very protective of the vehicle or small areas if somebody new comes around. She does not do well with cats or other animals such as livestock, because she has a very strong prey drive.  However, she does LOVE children!
LeeLoo know basic commands like sit, lay down and stay. Although sheâs had some training, she has some bad habits like counter surfing and getting into the trash.  Anything to get food.   If there is food left anywhere, she will try to get it.   She will also get bottles & containers that have food or drinks in them.  She has mild separation anxiety and will sometimes destroy things when you're gone, so when left alone she will need to be crated.  
LeeLoo should not be left alone in the yard, because she can jump/climb fences/gates that are 5 foot tall, so adopters must have a high privacy fence. She has mild food allergies, mostly to chicken. She is currently on a food from PetSmart called "" Authority"" Fish and Potato 'Skin, Coat and Digestive Health Support' and does really well on it.  
LeeLoo has a lot of quirks, but she is truly a great dog for somebody that has time to work with her.   
If youâd like to get more information on LeeLoo, or youâd like to meet her, you may contact her owner Ashley at 830-998-5882 or email: fancyfayza@yahoo.com

277,"Adoptable Murphy, affectionately called Dobby by his fosters, is the definition of a diamond in the rough. He is an 8 year old Male, Min pinscher mix. He struggles with first impressions, but given some time and patience, morphs into a very loving and sweet boy. In just the short time he's been with his new fosters (only a few days at this writing), he has become total couch snuggler and wigglebutt with us. He gets very excited to see us and has started playing with toys, even some tug-of-war with his pittie foster sister. Murphy needs a home that will let him blossom on his own schedule; patience (and treats) is the key to this sweetheart. Given his initial fears with new people and quick movements, a home without young children is best. If you're looking for a loyal best friend and are willing to give him the initial space to learn you, Murphy would be a perfect match. Don't rule out this grumpy looking old man, he has so much life and love left to give and would love to call you his human! If you are interested in Murphy, please email bowwowrevolution@gmail.com!"

Piggie is house trained, crate trained and loves everyone... including walks and snuggling on the couch as her pictures prove. Piggie loves toys and can entertain herself for hours.

Brody is a 4 year old, 9lb scruffy chihuahua/terrier mix that is the king of walks. Brody is crate trained, completely leash trained and as soon as he sees that leash he jumps up and runs towards the door. His dog walker loves his happy go lucky personality while enjoying the fresh air. Brody loves cuddling near you on the couch and in bed, but please respect his space; you know, because he is an independent man until he wants belly rubs. Not a fan of being picked up, unless on his terms so no kids for this guy. He gets along great with his foster brother, following each other around the house and sharing food. He would do fine as an only animal as well. Brody is gaining confidence every day and is looking for a home that would give him that time and love.

284,"Hi there! My name is Lassie, but some people call me GG. It is kind of a long story with my name, but hey, don't nicknames always have a story?! So let me tell you a few thing about myself... 

I am a beagle/dachshund mix, so I am full of spunk and love. When I arrived at HoundSong, I was a hot mess. However, now, my skin is looking better, I am gaining weight, and I am enjoying life. I love being around my humans. I am affectionate and a snuggler. I would do just fine as an only dog because then all of the love would be just for me. I do well with some dogs. I prefer dogs my size as big dogs stress me out. I currently live with a small, submissive, male cairn terrier, and we have a blast. We play all of the time. I do seem to like boys more than girls. It is probably because I was hit with the boys in my younger days. Now that I am 8 or 9 years old, I just want a boy as friend. I am house trained and do fine in my crate too, which is a bonus for both of us! I am sure you have just the right home for me, so go ahead and fill out the application.

They put me in doggie daycare to help. I started gainin some confidence and feelin a bit better bout myself. Donât get me wrong, I am still shy but get better every day. I am currently livin in a foster home with another more confident male black and tan. He is helping me come out of my shell more too. It was discovered that I feel more comfortable with woman. Their softer voices make me feel safer. Honestly, I think I would do real well in a home with another confident dog and a family who will help me get over my fears by givin me lots of lovin and attention.

286,"I may not have flowing red hair or a shimmering tail, but I still dream of having love and being with my humans. My name is Ariel, and I am a beautiful female treeing walker coonhound around 2 years old. I am relatively new to HoundSong but am getting settled right in. 

I live in a foster home with 3 kids ranging from toddler to teenager, and I absolutely adore all of them. I love lying my head on the toddlerâs lap while she enjoys her favorite TV show. I donât mind her touching me while I sleep and love all of her snuggles and kisses.  

I also live with another dog. He is older than me and doesnât always enjoy all of my young, playful ways. However, I am respectful. I would love another companion to play with me.  

Do you live somewhere with shared walls like a townhome or apartment? If you said yes, then unfortunately, I am probably not the pup for you. I have a tendency to whine when my foster family leaves. I am getting better, but just to be safe, I should probably live in a single family home.  

I am being a rock star at house training, so that is a win for everyone! Oh, and my foster mom has been taking me for daily walks, and she said I am getting better everyday. I really love those walks, so maybe you could take me on them too!

287,"Hi there! My name is Sprout, and I am an easy-going female beagle around 12 years old. When I arrived at HoundSong, I was in pretty rough shape. However, after a dental, where I lost almost all my teeth, and a mammary surgery, I am as good as new!

I simply love life and would make a wonderful, low-key companion.My foster family says I also love to nap and lounge around the house, so I would be the perfect match for a person who loves snuggle time on the couch.

I also enjoy walks and car rides. I am great with other dogs and love people, especially my foster dad. My foster family does not crate me because it really isn't needed. Except...I do sometimes like to walk across my foster dad's work desk to look out the window when he leaves. He says I am not purposely destructive. I just mess up settings on his computer. But I am so cute, he does not even get mad. 

I am doing well with my house training too! So if I sound like the companion of your dreams, please contact HoundSong. I promise you will not be disappointed.

288,"Ummm...hi there. My name is Fiona, and I am shy little beagle girl. See, I arrived at HoundSong after living my whole life outdoors as part of a beagle breeding situation. I am part of the TN 23 some of you may have heard about. My foster family is working hard to build my confidence, but I know I will need a patient, loving home, who can help me blossom. I am starting to warm up to my foster mom. I am not 100% convinced about my foster dad or the little two legged human. However, they are starting to do more things I like, so over time, I am sure I will grow closer to them too. I am doing okay with house training and crate training. I do prefer to be outdoors when possible as that is the only life I know.  My foster mom has been doing some leash work with me, but I am still a bit too scared to go too far. But the one time you can see me forgetting my past is when there are toys. I LOVE playing with toys. The squeaks and bouncing around makes me so happy. If you would like to learn more, please contact the folks at HoundSong. I just need a family who is willing to give me a chance and some extra TLC."
289,"Hi there. My name is Myhammie, and I am a sweet beagle boy. I am actually one of the Tennessee 23. Do you know that story? It was were Houndsong Rescue and several other rescues stepped up to save me and over 100 other beagles from a breeder. I am learning the ropes of living in a home but am still quite shy. See, I did not get much exposure living in outdoor kennels, so this life is totally new to me. Loud noises kind of scare me, and I am trying really hard to overcome my fears. I love other dogs, so I would love another confident, friendly dog in my forever home. I am also crate trained and house trained, so that is good for both of us. Want to learn more? Contact the HoundSong folks. I really want my own loving family to help me blossom and grow."
290,"Have you been thinking about adding a new beagle to your pack? If so, then you have to meet me! My name is Emmett, and I am around 8 years old.  

I am one of the TN 23. If you are not familiar with us, the HoundSong Rescue took in 23 beagles from a breeder in TN where there were over 100 beagles living. I didnât know much more of a life than a cage, but I am enjoying all of these new opportunities and moving forward with my life.  

I am great with the 3 other beagles in my foster home. Oh, and I do not mind the cats either!  

I am learning how to play with toys. I like the squeaky ones!  

Live in an apartment or townhome? I may not be the best fit for you. See, I can be a talker...especially when I want to eat! And I could still use some leash work, but my foster mom is working on that with me.  

I am not 100% housetrained yet, but I am getting there! My foster mom says I am a pretty quick learner.  

Want to know more? Contact the folks at HoundSong. They can answer all of your questions!"
291,"Crockett (aka Davey Crockett) is a 3-4 yr old blue tick beagle boy who loves the outdoors and just as his name implies, grew up in Tennessee. He weighs about 20-25 pounds, has a heart of gold, and is learning the joy of treats. He is crate trained and is doing well with potty training. He also met some caged kitties at the vet and wasnât too interested, so we donât think kitties will be an issue.  

 
Crockett is still uncertain about normal household noises. He likes to come over for pets and a treat outside but so far is not a snuggler. He prefers his own space, but will share the sofa with the resident dogs as long as there is no touching. He shows his mischievous side by dragging clothes and blankets through the house enticing the other dogs to play. He sleeps quietly in a crate in foster momâs bedroom at night - once he has his bedtime snack!  

 
Crockett loves to be outside (quickly learned to use the dog door) where he plays with the resident dogs, finds all the wonderful smells and just relaxes. He is not a big barker. A securely fenced yard and another playful dog in a fairly calm home would be ideal for Crockett. He walks pretty well on leash with another dog, but darts and cowers when alone (a work in progress). He does like to attack hoses, electrical cords, cable cords, etc., so no need for adopters to worry about those scary items.

292,"Hi there. My name is Molly, and I am shy female beagle. I am actually one of the Tennessee 23. If you do not know about that rescue situation, the HoundSong Rescue and several other rescues helped save me and over 100 other beagles from a breeding situation. I am enjoying my new home life, but some things scare me like loud noises. I am also a little unsure about kids and men. My foster family is working really hard to earn my trust, and I am bonding with my foster mom. She is my safe person. My foster mom thinks I will be an amazing companion once I gain some more confidence. She thinks I would do best in a home with another dog, who is confident and can teach me their ways.

LEASH TEST: https://youtu.be/IHGzjOEjd7Q

JUNE - If you give Cookie a ball, you've made her day. That's all she really wants. We played 2-ball fetch and she was working on dropping her ball to get the other one thrown. When she got tired of that she found a shady spot to rest under with her trusty ball. She doesn't guard or protect the ball - it's just like her thing she likes having close by. Cookie is pretty independent from what we've seen. She is happy to be off on her own doing her own thing. So if you're looking for a snuggle partner, she may not be your girl. But if you want to play fetch and have a nice dog around who isn't under your feet - check Cookie out.

APRIL - Cookie came to acc as a stray and is estimated at 3 years old. It appears sheâs been a momma and Cookie is hoping to find a new family where she wonât be breed. She was easy to leash and eager to exit the pavilion. She didnât respond to the other dogs as she walked down the pavilion. Cookie is a young girl who loves squeak toys. She enjoys toys more than treats. 

MARCH - Cookie is a low rider with energy to burn. Sheâll fetch & drop it but is working on return. Cookie knows sit and has nice eye contact. Cookie doesnât seek affection, she has an independent streak but she was on stray hold and needed yard time to get her zoomies out. Sheâs a great size, not very big and under many apartment size restrictions. Cookie would benefit from training to expand on the commands she already knows. Meet this bundle of cuteness.

294,"Hammy is a 2 year old neutered male who came into the shelter on 8/7 as an owner surrender.    He was at CACC in January as a stray and returned to his owner.

Poor Hammy has been to CACC too many times. He was surrendered by his owner this time due to not having enough time for Hammy.Â 

Hammy just wants to go-go-go. I didn't think I would be able to get a photo of him because he would not stop moving. He wants to see what is going on over there and over there and over there. We played ball for about 5 seconds before he heard some sound and went off the check it out. Hammy was very interested in other dogs and vocal they came close. Hopefully this energetic guy's 2nd stay with us is short and he finds a real forever home.

PLAYGROUP 10/1: https://youtu.be/ILwvqImoIDA
VIDEO 9/1: https://youtu.be/kjlkepYx3r0
VIDEO: https://youtu.be/rGxAW8d74eM

SEPTEMBER - Copa was bouncing on his bed in his cage like a toddler - more than ready to get outside and run around. He can be very focused on other dogs when outside, but I found a fun squeaky toy for him to play with and that took his attention away from all the doggos. That toy was all he needed today. He wasn't interested in treats or pets - just running and rolling in the grass with his toy. Copa is an energetic guy who would benefit from an active adopter who can give him plenty of playtime each day. 

Copa has started to attend dog playgroup. He was social with the dogs he was paired with and enjoyed a little chase in play. 

AUGUST - After Copa hypnotizes you with his beautiful black lips (usually in an upside down smile) and the cutest tri-colored ear, he seals the deal with his lively personality. Even though he had a go slow note, once his stray hold was over he was more than ready to come out, he practically leashes himself. Outside he can be stubborn when he wants to smell something for 10 minutes but heâs thankfully a lightweight and can be moved if necessary. Copa was camera shy when showing off his sit but he can do it very well. Plus he wasnât very motivated by my treats either but his stomach was upset. 

It only took a brief introduction in the run before Copa was invading my personal space. He loves to be close, sitting on your lap in every possible way. He didnât show any interest in toys and seemed distracted when other dogs passed by. The first time going back in his kennel was tough for him, but now he gets the drill and knows there will be a next time.

296,"Nino is a 5 year old male who came into the shelter on 8/17 as an owner surrender. 

VIDEO:Â https://youtu.be/_SATXaWWJ1g

Oh, Nino. This poor dude is so confused about where he is and why heâs there. He came in as an owner surrender a few days ago simply because his owner âdidnât want him anymore.â  Nino lived with a 7 year old child and spent his time both inside and outside.  

Nino is definitely potty trained â he was so eager to get outside to go. He can be strong on leash but Iâm certain part of the reason for that is because heâs so potty trained. Heâs very sweet and can be quite affectionate, it just takes him some time. He likes to be petted/scratched but it definitely took him some time to focus on me and after a while, he chilled out and seemed to enjoy our time together. Nino seemed a bit reactive in the medical runs, not sure if itâs barrier reactivity or otherwise. We walked around the yard for a while longer, but Nino continued to want to walk the perimeter and owner search. Dogs like Nino especially break my heartâ¦ theyâre just so confused and stressed out but we know thereâs a great dog in there, it just takes Nino a second to let his guard down in the shelter environment and show it.

PLAYGROUP 8/22:Â https://youtu.be/2ngT73Vj4nA

SEPTEMBER - Hoops loves all the toys. He plays with everything in front of him - little toys, big toys, he doesn't care. He's a really energetic guy so toys are a good way to try to tire him out (which I'm not sure we can do). Hoops can be a strong puller on leash and can be all over the place. It's probable in his young life he was never trained on how to walk on a leash. He is treat motivated and can use some help learning how to take them gently. Hoops would benefit from an adopter who understand that he needs training (and lots of playtime) to help him grow into a great adult dog.Â 

Hoops has been tested for dog playgroup.  He can be very vocal and reactive at barriers and takes along time to settle down.  He is young and can be intense towards other dogs and would do best with resilient playmates who wonât react negatively to his pushy play. 

AUGUST - I just love this goofball. He is young and handsome and so playful. Hoops earned his name because he spent a good portion of our time together trying to fit basketballs into his mouth lol. Every so often, he'd move on to a small ball and do the same. Eventually, he got the hang of fetch and was good at it. He had no issues giving the ball up when I requested it and enjoyed running back and forth to fetch. Hoops quikly learned to sit for treats and allowed me to pet him and play with his goofy ears. He would make a great addition to any home or family that wants a playful, active dog, who also enjoys getting loved on. Great guy!Â

SEPTEMBER - Roly Poly loves to play tug.  We found a big rope toy and she had a blast chasing after it and pulling with me.  When she gets overexcited she can sometimes want to tug on your shoes and pants too so sheâs going to need some training to help her learn what is appropriate to tug - and what isnât.  Roly Poly has a nice sit and takes treats well but she was super picky with my treats today and spit them out - ha ha.  Once I wore her out with tug, she leaned in for lots of petting and back scratches.  Sheâs a fun girl who would do best in an active home that can also work with her on basic manners training.  

AUGUST - Roly Poly is a bundle of fun! This girl is a extremely adorable, young dog. She's so cute with her little potbelly. In cage she is really sweet and easy to leash up. She was a little scared in the pavilion walking out and doorways frightened her a bit. But outside, outside she's a little spit fire cutie pie! Roly Poly went potty right away and then was ready to play. 

Roly Poly sits on command and takes treats very gently. She thinks she's a lap dog too. Roly will plop her entire body into your lap and encourage you to rub her belly. I was able to handle her with easy, touching her paws, look at her shiny white teeth, and give her lots of hugs and kisses. Roly showed minor interest in toys and is treat motivated. A really fun little lady.

Roly Poly has started to attend dog playgroup.  She is a social dog who likes to bump and chase with her play partners (and sometimes hump).

I met Shay a day after she was surrendered due to her owner losing their home. She did a bit of owner searching in the yard which is always sad to see. Right off the bat Shay met 2 dogs outside (a male and a female) and did really well. She is easy to handle and walks nicely on leash. Shay takes treats gently but spits out ones she doesnât like - ha ha. So only good treats for her from now on! Shay acted appropriately when I was down at her level - she didnât jump or climb all over me - just sat nicely by my side and offered me a few kisses before going back to watching all the dogs in the yard. Shay is a sweet dog and I hope her stay at the shelter is a short one.

Koko sits in her cage calmly just waiting for someone to come take her out. Outside she shows that she's a young dog who probably hasn't had much training. She jumps up on leash and can be all over the place while walking. But off-leash Koko chills out nicely and can be quite calm and affectionate. We had a great time together with her sitting on my lap and taking treats from my bag. Koko would love to find a home that can work with her on training and give her all the playtime and love she needs to grow into a great adult dog.Â

Heâs playful and interested in toys, but really more interested in human attention. Schwartz doesnât really stay still but certainly seems like heâs eager to learn. Heâll take a treat or two â gently â and will focus after a bit. Allowed me to check his teeth, ears, etc., out with no issues.

Heâs in great shape with a beautiful coat and nice teeth, heâs also got the cutest little face.  Blue has a major case of FOMO, though, and will be vocal when he sees other dogs but itâs just because he wants to play.  Heâs been attending dog playgroup and has been a rockstar.  Blue has tons of potential so for any of you folks out there looking for younger dogs / puppies, here you go!

Blue was surrendered due to original owners not having time for him.

OCTOBER - Rangoon loves toys almost as much as he loves snuggling! As soon as we entered the play area, he ran from toy to toy and couldnât decided which one he liked best. Heâs a silly guy, constantly wagging his tail with his lonnnnnng tongue hanging out of the side of his mouth. Rangoon enjoys being pet and hugged, even plopped down in my lap a few times. Although he initially had a lot of energy, he was worn out after about 20 min. of running around. An active family to call his own and a huge pile of toys would no doubt make his tail wag from sunup to sundown!

AUGUST - Rangoon is such a hoot. This guy canât wait to get outside to play and hang out! He can be strong on leash at first but heâs just anxious to get out. Rangoon wants all of your attention and will jump up for it at first, but is corrected/redirected pretty easily. He doesnât seem to know any commands (or was too excited to show me) but was very gentle with treats and is an EXCELLENT fetch partner. He will retrieve and return with ease. It looks as though Rangoon is getting over some skin issues but they donât bother him at all. His teeth are shiny and white. Rangoon let me touch his paws/ears/the whole nine yards and couldnât care less. This boy was just happy to be outside, and to play with me!Â

Shi is ready for a constant playmate. Sheâs energetic especially after such a long stray hold. She came right up to be leashed and walked past the barking dogs like they didnât exist. Outside she dropped right into a sit before I could even ask. She saw my treats and knew just what to do, little smarty pants! Shi knows other commands too. Someone has already put in the work to train her. She allowed for handling all over, wasnât very interested in toys (no matter how I danced them in front of her), and took treats very nicely. Shi was desperate for attention and got pretty excited when I crouched down to her level. She wanted to give constant kisses to show her appreciation. When Shi got a chance to meet another dog on leash, she didnât disappoint with her multiple play moves!

314,"Polly is a 3 year old spayed female who came into the shelter on 10/6 as a stray.

VIDEO:Â https://youtu.be/7H0hfvgwtmQ
LEASH TEST:Â https://youtu.be/m2olOp-YjKM

Polly is so sweet! She is young and fun. No issues leashing her up and walking past the other dogs. In fact, she had to stop and say hello to a few on her way out of the pavilion. Outside she loves to be close. Polly is the type of dog who will get right into your lap and kiss your face. Very affectionate. She is a little head shy, but trusting to us. No issues with handling, petting her all over, touching her paws, and giving her a big hug. Was a little uncomfortable with teeth examination by just avoiding it. Super fun. Loved to be loved. An easy going girl who did great on leash test with play bows.

PLAYGROUP 10/3: https://youtu.be/e8aSFiMbTco
PLAYGROUP 9/26: https://youtu.be/Mjo_9owGNcs

OCTOBER - Goose is sooooo playful. He loves to run around and spend time with ALL the toys in the playlot. He likes soft ones he can tear up and enjoys playing 2 ball fetch. He tried to bury his balls in a stack of leaves which was very cute. Goose is a strong puller on leash because he has soooo much energy he needs to get out. Goose would be great with an active adopter who can give him all the exercise this young guy needs.

Goose has started to attend dog playgroup. He is very focused on chasing his play partners and needs resilient, forgiving playmates and some human management. He does not slow down and will run right into play partners. 

SEPTEMBER - Goose is a really cute, calmer small/medium sized guy. He is really easy to handle - no issues coming in or out of kennel. While Goose allowed me to pet him and be near him, he just really loved chewing on tennis balls more than anything. We were outside on two beautiful days and Goose just enjoyed laying in the grass, chewing away, basking in the sun. Since he seemed so content, I didn't want to really bother him. He sits in a noisy shelter the rest of the day, I wanted him to have some peace and quiet. He seems very well mannered - no jumping, mouthing, humping etc. Just a really good boy!! And super cute, too. He has a nice calm energy about him that will certainly rub off on anyone who meets him.

Dutch is incredibly adaptable. This poor guy was found outside by a good samaritan that brought him to animal control. He must have been someone's pet at one point who was left outside or got lost. FCACC rescued him and we are so happy we did! He's an amazing cat who would love nothing more than someone to cuddle with. He's calm, easy going, and adaptable. 

Like some people, Dutch has allergies which has caused him to lose some of his fur (which is now growing back)! This is easily controlled with a wet food, grain free diet. Please consider meeting this awesome cat whose allergies do not slow him down at all!

Could it be yours? 

Ranger is currently in foster with his three kittens. They were rescued off of the streets of Chicago. It's hard to believe this handsome boy was left to fend for himself. He had scabs from fights all over his body, but they're all healed, and his heart is healing as well. He can be adopted with one of his kittens, or as a single cat.

356,"This is a courtesy posting for a foster. Please see the bottom of the description for contact information.

Squirt showed up one day on the doorstep of a very nice retired lady who loves cat, but couldn't keep her.  We have no idea where she came from, but it was clear she was very friendly and was looking for a home.

Squirt is instantly seeking affection as soon as you walk into the room.  She is already purring, has her tail high in the air, and starts walking towards you for pets.  She is a quiet and gentle kitten, but is also active and playful.  She loves to bat around ping pong balls at all hours of the day and night.

During her brief stay with her retired caretaker, she was very curious of her other cats and never hissed at them. She would likely do well with other cats or dogs and also likes kids.

She was born in late June. She has been spayed, vaccinated, microchipped and is parasite free. Her adoption fee of $95 covers the cost of vet services.  

Squirt is currently in a foster home awaiting her forever home. To schedule a play date, please contact Liz at 773-898-9899 or catwomanliz@yahoo.com"

WWE fans.....Do you smelllllllllll what The Roger is cooking?

Thatâs right, yâall. We got ourselves another sugarplum, snuffle-puff available for adoption soon! My friend picked him up and tried to find his owners, but no luck. He was brought to CACC for his stray hold.

Why the name Roger? Well when he was picked up from the shelter, we thought this was an old man from the way he looked. We love our seniors as if they were puppies. But in reality, teeth being good evidence for age range, Roger just has that gentleman like appearance. However, he had early signs of cherry eyes in both eyes, so we had them repaired.

Roger is a 1.5 year old Maltese/maybe Poodle mix, around 12 lbs and gets along superbly with kids, dogs, and kitties. We want Roger to be adopted into a home with another playful dog(s). He is a goofy boy and loves to play all the time. He still is very much puppy-like and loves to flip over for belly rubs. He also carries his favorite toys around with him wherever he goes. Unfortunately, we noticed after he was neutered that he shows signs of having a tracheal collapse. This means that he will need extra care to make sure that he does not get too excited and will always need to be walked with a harness instead of a collar. There is no treatment for it at this moment, but it may mean that he will require more visits to the vet in the future. He is still coughing some, but it has gotten significantly better since his surgery. There is no permanent solution for this, so it will be something he has for the remainder of his life and there is a possibility that it will get worse. It is definitely something that should be researched before you decide to commit to being his furever home. If you believe you will be able to give him a great home, please don't hesitate to send in your application for him!"

I've had a German exchange dog in my home for about a month. I couldn't understand why we weren't communicating. Little did I know, my German exchange dog only spoke Spanish!

This is Kaiser. Gorgeous beyond belief, Kaiser. At 11 years old and 89 lbs, this outside dog was surrendered to the shelter because his owners did not want to pay for his medical care. He is a long coat GSD, but you probably couldn't tell from his profile picture. Why was he shaved? Well, his bumps and lumps had maggots inside them. I don't know if he ever got a grooming before as he never lived indoors for 11 years. Thankfully his hair is hair. It will grow back soon, although he is quite striking with the peach fuzz. 

Kaiser knows commands in Spanish, so time to learn a new language! He is on medication to help with his arthritis and we hope it lengthens the time he has on this earth. At 11 years old, retirement is NOW. Kaiser is not housebroken or is incontinent. I can't tell. He wears a belly band (male diaper) just in case and it seems to work. He does know to hold it, but sometimes will just be like IDGAF. He will poop in your house randomly and usually everyday. 

Kaiser is friendly to everyone. Even though he didn't live with dogs, he absolutely loves dogs. He also lived with kids, so if you want to teach your kids how to love an old soul, he might be the one. 

Kaiser does bark a lot, however, so apartment dwellers beware. Kaiser will bark for attention and he will use his head to push you in the hallways. He is very demanding with food to, so if you leave food low enough, he will gobble it up before you know it. I know this from experience. RIP Chipotle. Overall, Kaiser is super laid back and lays down often being you know like ancient. He walks so well on the leash too and I honestly, love him to pieces. 

He had many growths removed off his body but no guarantee they won't grow back. It is now his time to spread his wings and join a new, deserving family. He is neutered, chipped, and vaccinated. If you are interested in Kaiser, please apply at leadrescue.org."

Wombat will be available after October 27.

Wooly man, Wombat. Yes, I know, he looks like Dobby from Harry Potter. But before he looked like that, he looked like the saddest Wombat ever. Matted from head to his cutting off circulating foot, Wombat is another case of WTF happened to you? Where are your owners? Are you okay, baby?

Wombat is, we think, a Bichon Frise Poodle mix that didn't deserve to live the way he had been for God knows how long. But it's okay, bud. Ever since his rescue from my Dunkin Donuts loving husband, Wombat got the spa treatment of a lifetime. He of course was not happy, feeling the tugging of the hair all over. I mean imagine getting your blood pressure done.....every second of your life. THAT STINGS! So at the vet, they sedated him, so he could wake up, feeling better than ever. After all the hair was removed, we could finally see the underbite of all underbites. The vet could finally see his teeth and estimates he is between 5-8 years old.

Let me tell you, the haircut, the warmth of a home, and endless blankets to snuggle into has changed Wombat's life forever. He now proceeds to be a couch potato with you on your lap. He nudges you for pets and will stare at you with those hungry, puppy eyes if you don't give in. He seems to be a one person dog or at least attached to me. He likes the chill vibe I give off and he is down for a nap anytime you want it.

Wombat would do great with a person or a couple. He is going to single out who he loves more (so if you are the affectionate one, well make sure you give him that and he'll choose you!). As I write this, he sits on my lap, protecting me from my own pack of dogs that are jelly of my love. Otherwise, he is fine with dogs in the home as long as they aren't super hyper or want to play with him. He just wants to chill-ax. He can live in an apartment or house as he is so quiet, I forget he's there. I mean I don't since he's on my lap but you get what I mean.

Wombat will be available for adoption after October 27. He will have a dental done, be neutered, and micro-chipped. He is also vaccinated. Also, as of a couple days ago, he has learned to go to the bathroom outside but he will use pee pads if needed. If you are interested in his sexy underbite, please apply at leadrescue.org."

Crap. Cage full of crap. That's how we ended up with this dog.

We were notified by a fellow rescuer about a dog that was being surrendered because they were moving. But from the picture that was sent to me, it looked like he lived in a small crate dried with urine and feces. I mean you are ""moving"", so why not keep your beloved pet in a crap-tastic cage? On the day he was surrendered to my friend, he was brought out in that crap-tastic cage. He's about 8 months old. A pup. How long did it take for the cuteness to wear off and couldn't be bothered with him anymore?

I named him Bento Box because he is a mixture of eclectic breeds, I bet. And Bento boxes are delish. Delish like Mr. Bento himself.

While being fostered, he's been able to stretch his legs and run with his fellow dog sibs. He has actually become a spunky, extremely playful boy from the first day he came into LEAD. I mean why wouldn't he? He is only crated for short periods. NOT FOREVER. He does take a bit to completely warm up to new people, but overall, he's adjusting nicely outside the cage doors. He follows his foster mom like a shadow and when picked up, swims like if he is in water. He is saying, ""Come save me. I can't float in the air.""

Bento will be neutered next week (October 27) and get everything else done for him before adoption. He will also be micro chipped and vaccinated. He does bark, so he is not a good apartment dog. He isn't fully housebroken, but can we blame him? He pooped literally where he ate and slept for however long. But someone who has a fenced in yard, this could do wonders for him. He is perfectly fine and playful with dogs both big and small, but is scared of cats (they make him growl, but he won't actually do anything to them). Unsure how he is with kids, but will find out.

Wrigley is the sibling of Beanie and Topper, who we had for a bit in our rescue before they found their homes. Wrigley, Wrigley, Wrigley. We also have his brother, Casper, but his info is on his own page. Wrigley is a gum fan and not a baseball lover. He would be happiest to be adopted by any team really.

Wrigley is a 5 year old, strikingly gorg long coat Chihu. His eyes are piercing. The Brad Pitt and George Clooney of dogs. Wrigs gets along well with his brother Casper, but is a butthole and beats Casper up. So it's best that Wrigs finds his own baseball team of people instead. Wrigs loves kids because they are small and dainty just like him.

As mentioned, Wrigley never had any medical care prior and left LEAD Rescue to pick up the pieces. While he was being neutered, you know so he can't make more Brad Pitt like babies that will end up with us, we had a dental done. With that dental came findings of teeth that ""looked"" like they were extracted or that he spent time in a cage, trying to chew his way out. His mouth showed signs of his gums had grown over his roots. I prayed to the Higher power that he was not in any pain beforehand and luckily he is not. However, it still angers me to think that somehow this was overlooked for years. 

Basically it just means that Wrigley moving forward in a new home, could mean another dentist visit in the future. We did what we could to help and looking for an owner that is okay with maybe a future surgery at some point. 

Wrigs took a few days to become acclimated to his new foster, but after some R and R, he follows her around like a little duckling. HE LOVES KIDS by the way! In his old home, he was able to go to the bathroom where he pleased, so we are crossing our fingers that the marking decreases over time. But otherwise, he uses pee pads and should wear male diapers. He does go potty outside too. He is a barker sometimes, but what Chihuahua isn't? He doesn't bark as much as his brother, so that's good and I imagine if he wasn't with Casper anymore, the barking would decrease.

Marilyn Monroe didn't always have such a glamorous name. She also didn't have such a glamorous lifestyle. Let it be known that Monroe lived with other unfortunate souls, on a 4 foot chain, outside, with a doghouse for we believe 11 months of her life. The chain was heavier than her. Monroe is 27 lbs.

With her heart shaped nose and with her eye makeup already done, Marilyn Monroe just fit. We want to see this girl grow up into the brave female dog we know she can be.

Marilyn came into LEAD Rescue after she was confiscated and her life was situated with Safe Humane Chicago. What does that mean? It means her adopter will have free lifetime trainings and support for Marilyn.

We believe this little lucky lady is a Beagle/Pitbull mix. She is small, sweet, timid, adorable, and honestly a wonderful dog. She 110% needs to be adopted into a home with another dog(s). Her self-esteem really picks up and we want to see her happy forever.

She is not housebroken yet, but we don't blame her from only knowing how to go to the bathroom where she slept and never being indoors. She is a pup and some training will definitely be needed. If you have a fenced in yard or love to go on potty break walks, this is the dog you will want. She does bark when she is left alone, so apartment living is a no no. 

Marilyn Monroe will be spayed soon. She is vaccinated and chipped already. Yay! If you are interested in this bombshell with permanent eyelined eyes, please apply at leadrescue.org."

Casper is the sibling of Beanie and Topper, who we had for a bit in our rescue before they found their homes. We also have his brother, Wrigley, but his info is on his own page. 

Casper is a 5 year old Chihu with blue glass see through eyes. He is more reserved than his brother and that's why he has little bite marks on him. So that being said, we would love Casper to find his own home where he can bully, I don't know, nothing. Casper, just like Wrigley, loves kids because they are small and dainty just like him. He is a perfect little dog that loves to be on your lap whenever your lap is ready for some warmth.

As mentioned, Casper never had any medical care prior and left LEAD Rescue to pick up the pieces. While he was being neutered, we had a dental done. With that dental came findings of teeth that ""looked"" like they were extracted or that he spent time in a cage, trying to chew his way out. His mouth showed signs of his gums had grown over his roots. Casper had to have 6 teeth removed as well. I prayed to the Higher power that he was not in any pain beforehand and luckily he is not. However, it still angers me to think that somehow this was overlooked for years. What they also found is a grade 5-6 heart murmur. This just means that we can not predict how long Casper has. He can live for a long time or a few more years. We would like an adopter who understands this and would be more than willing to help Casper live out the rest of his days in happiness. 

Casper took a few days to become acclimated to his new foster, but after some R and R, he follows her around like a little duckling. In his old home, he was able to go to the bathroom where he pleased, so we are crossing our fingers that the marking decreases over time. But otherwise, he uses pee pads and should wear male diapers.

Country-lovin' Nashville is darn tootin' available for adoption after November 23 (neuter date). This delectable, scrumptious boy that we caught on a cold October day out in a field is the sweetest thang.

11 months of puppyhood. 11 months of soft and sweet. 11 months of piss and vinegar too.  We believe he was possibly dumped and after his chip hold was done, we said, ""YASSS."" We think he is a Husky with Border Collie because the way that his body moves, it feels like he is a herder. But not a very good one at that.

He loves dogs and people. He is just the best. He probably does well with kids too and if you have kids that run not just their mouths, this guy might be a hit.

He is very smart and has incredible natural drive. He would do really well in activities such as agility, nose work, or as a sport dog. He works hard to please his humans and is very treat and toy motivated. 

Rocky has worked with professional trainers and would do best in a home with a human who is willing to continue that training.

Have you heard of Black Cat Syndrome? It refers to the phenomenon that many shelters experience when it comes to adopting out black cats (and black dogs). Sadly, they are often the last to find forever homes. Why are black cats and dogs so often left behind? Many who work in rescue believe it has to do with the fact that itâs harder for people to read the expressions on the faces of the black cats and dogs. Additionally for cats, they carry the baggage of ridiculous superstition and being referred to as bad luck (although they are actually considered GOOD luck in the UK!!). Donât pass up the opportunity to provide a forever home for a black cat or a black dog. Youâll receive a gift of love beyond your expectations!

438,"Two-year-old Neena is both wise for her years and as playful as a kitten. She loves throwing her favorite yellow toy mouse into the air, watching it land and then pouncing on it as if sheâd never seen it before. But she's also the kind of cat that senses when people are upset and comes to sit next to them. Itâs pretty hard not to smile at her black smudge nose and sincere expression.

Neena was probably a pet at some point in her life. But when we found her, she was living in the back yard of a house in Pilsen. She had learned to take of herself. Still, she wanted a family, hanging around the back porch of the home and watching people come and go.

When Neena was rescued and brought indoors, she seemed relieved to have someone caring for her. She showed her appreciation by tentatively walking up to her new human friends, licking their hands clean (much like a mom would do with her kittens) and purring. A few weeks after she arrived, she was ready to accept pets on the head, but only if she was being fed Gerberâs chicken baby food at the same time! After that, she wanted chin scratches, and finally tummy rubs. She now likes to be picked up, as long as itâs for a short period. 

Neena remains cautious when new people come around, but that just makes her affection so much more meaningful: It needs to be earned with a little bit of patience.

In addition to her human friends, Neena has found a new cat buddy. It didnât take long for her to become friends with fellow foster cat Cordelia, indicating she would be a good companion for another playful kitty. After a few days of eyeing each other, Neena and Cordelia started playing, and they have never stopped. 

They also taught each other all kinds of cat things. For example. Neena didnât know how to use a cardboard scratching pad. But she watched â studied â Cordeliaâs technique and then jumped onto the scratching pad and has proudly used it every day since. In exchange, Neena showed Cordelia the game of âchase you, chase me,â which appears to have only one rule: to race around the room at high speeds until you both collapse, sometimes mid-stride. Neena then takes a nap, nice and warm, and no longer outside.

and playfulness that makes her hoo-mans smile, running from room to
room and crinkling her way though her favorite kitty tunnel. Once
she's finally worn herself out, she'll look to you for a belly rub so
she can fall asleep in your arms - and she will MEOW if you move her
before she's ready. Rocky Road, her sister on the other paw, is more chillax,
preferring short belly rubs and passin'-by pets. She's more interested
in messing with her sis, jumping out to scare her for a couple of

448,"Mellow and chill, little Apollo likes to lay on rocking chairs or comfy couches and just kinda take it all in. Of course, kittens are kittens, so he's got a serious weakness for feathers on strings and wrestling with other cats. Naturally, he's got a high level of energy and an irresistibly soft gray coat, so it's a fun challenge to get him to let you pet his belly! We adore playing with and watching this sweet little furball, and think you will too. This sweet boy was born late March early April 2018.

449,"The resident purr monster in her current foster home, Bella warms up
to strangers quickly and loves to share her ribbon dancer with them.
She also loves food, almost comically so, and will lead you into the
kitchen to get her food prepared for her! Bella is really smart and
catches on fast - she recently discovered how a window works and is
fascinated by it, sitting nearby and chattering at birds and
passersby. She loves to play, but really appreciates downtime to
explore the things around her. Pull her close and have a quick chat
about your day, or show her something new, and she'll become your new
BFF before you know it. Bellatrix was born April 18, 2018.

450,"Pepe greets his favorite hoo-mans with a sweet meow and rub, hoping to be picked up and held close after a long day apart. He's a total lap cat, and if you're anywhere near the couch, he's definitely gonna curl up by you for a bit. As affectionate as he is, Pepe also loves to make his people laugh by rolling and turning upside down to catch your attention, or tackling your feet to wrestle for a minute or two. He's a great companion for a low-key hoo-man who enjoys cuddles and playfulness on the regular. So if that sounds like you, come meet Pepe Le Pew.  Pepe and his siblings were born May 27th, 2018. They love playing with each other, the big cats in the house and children.  They are also good with cat friendly dogs.

451,"A little on the cautious side, but infinitely loving, Looney is such a sweet cat. He loves being held, or to settle near you for a long snuggle on a lazy afternoon. Once he's warmed up to you, he'll make it
a habit to greet you with a hello and to look for a rub. It's around this time that you'll start to notice his social sideâhe absolutely loves other cats, and looks for opportunities to play with them whenever possible. If there are no other cats around, though, kids will do just fine, and he's happy to hitch a ride with a kiddo who just wants to hold him, because he loves the attention. Come meet this cool cat today. They are good with other cats, kids and cat friendly dogs.  They also love each other so would like to be adopted with a littermate. They were born May 27th, 2018.

452,"This fun, fearless feline loves everyone he meets. Very outgoing and independent, he loves to explore and play, and his foster says he's paws-down the bravest kitty. He's usually the first to investigate a new toy or hiding spot, and he really enjoys meeting new cats to play with. He's also the class clown oftentimes, cracking us up by trying to stir the pot among his siblings. When he's done causing general cat mischief, he'll let you hold him and give him scritches til he falls asleep. We just adore Warner - he's the best.  Warner and his siblings were born May 27th, 2018. Warner loves cats, kids, his litter mates and cat friendly dogs.

453,"Drake, like this Canadian rap superstar namesake, is quite the hit with the ladies. A handsome, medium-sized shepherd mix, Drake is an affectionate, tolerant, happy-go-lucky dog who only needs one warm look and a goofy smile to make the dames fall over him! Drake was found by some concerned citizens running loose in the woods. He was never reclaimed, but someone else's loss might be your gain! Drake is almost 4 years old, and he's got all those adult dog behaviors on lock - he's housetrained, active but mellows out, and friendly with people big and small after a proper introduction. He's a very vocal player, so it takes a bit of getting used to when he whines and growls while tossing his toy around. It's all talk, though - Drake wants nothing more than to have a confident, kind human companion to hang out with! He is not comfortable with other dogs and cats, and he can be reactive towards other animals on leash. Because of this, Drake will have to be a solo dog for life, but his good temper and playful spirit are more than enough love for the right family. He'll do best in a smaller home with lots of dog experience and no children. Drake would love someone to be his leader and show him how great life can be outside of the shelter. If you're interested in meeting Drake, please email Gabrielle at caninemanager@animalcareleague.org for more info!"
454,"Big, orange Ollie is exactly what we want in our orange tabbies - he's 100% confident love bug! This big boy is 5 years old, and he was adopted from ACL a few years ago. Unfortunately, his adopter had to move, and Ollie couldn't come along. Ollie is a confident cat who likes other felines as long as he gets to be the boss! He adores people and exploring, and he'd love a home that had an equal amount of pet time and watching out the window time. Ollie can get a little overexcited when he gets super intensive pets, so he'd do best with an adopter who's had a cat before and can read his communications. Ollie is a great kitty who can't wait to join someone's family. He'll do well with respectful kids 12 and up, other cats, and maybe even dog after a proper introduction."
455,"Handsome, charming Isaac is a stealth operator - he'll steal your heart without you noticing! He's a 10 1/2 year old American Eskimo/terrier supermutt who arrived at ACL as a stray. He was very worried and unsure when he first arrived, and he didn't want to make friends. We knew it was an act, though, and we soon found that he's a loyal, loving dog who adores being with his people. He takes a little bit of patience to warm up to new people, but once you're in with Isaac, you're IN! His trust once earned is a permanent gift. Isaac isn't comfortable with other animals, so he'd prefer to be a solo pet. He's a persnickety little terrier, so he'd do best with adult homes only that have some experience taking their time getting to know a new dog. Isaac's dream is to be the loyal companion to a quiet home who just wants a dog to go for short walks, have lots of pet time, and share their lives with. Isaac is a senior guy who is looking for a nice retirement home! If Isaac could be the missing piece you've been looking for, please email Gabrielle at caninemanager@animalcareleague.org to schedule a meet!"
456,"Spunky, happy-go-lucky Laurel is looking to bring sunshine into your life! She's a 2 year old Visla mix who is a true medium size dog at 40 pounds. She arrived at ACL as a stray, but it was clear from the first moment that she was someone's beloved pet at some point - she's just too sweet! Laurel loves people and is happy to give kisses all day long. She has a strong sense of smell, and she loves to follow her nose. That tendency plus her eager interest in squirrels suggest maybe she's mixed with a beagle! Laurel is gentle and loving, put she is a nervous nelly here at the shelter. She needs a little bit of work so she doesn't get too excited about small animals while she's on her walks or meeting new strangers, but Laurel is super smart and eager to learn more. For now, she'd do best with adult homes only with no other pets. With a loving family, she can learn anything you want to teach her! Just promise to love her at the same time! Email Gabrielle at caninemanager@animalcareleague.org to learn more!"
457,"Vinnie is a very special cat who has been in and out of the shelter since he was a kitten.  Vinnie was brought to ACL at just 8 weeks of age when a resident found him in a dumpster next to her home.  He was quickly adopted, but found himself back at the shelter when his family moved and did not take him along.  In his first home, Vinnie was declawed on all four paws.  Since then, Vinnie has struggled to find his place.  He has been in and out of foster and adoptive homes, never finding the right fit.  Since Vinnie has been back in our program since 2015, we have lots of information on what he needs to be the best cat he can be!  ACL knows that Vinnie has the potential to find a loving and home where he will make a great companion for the right person.  Vinnie is quite a handsome guy, so we do receive lots of inquiries for him.  Since we have lots of information on Vinnie, we will be taking some extra special care in his adoption process (which will be different from our regular adoption process).   Please note that we are looking for an adopter that has the time to work through Vinnieâs challenges, and who will go the extra mile to ensure that their relationship gets off on the right foot!  Vinnie may enjoy the company of another pet, depending on their personality.  He will require an adult household.  

Interested adopters should fill out the questionnaire here: https://goo.gl/forms/tmd361vNxXHRKUsW2

Please give a staff member 24-36 hours to contact you after you submit your response.  Please note that Vinnieâs adoption process will be a bit lengthier than our regular process."

This sweet girl was originally adopted out from our shelter as a kitten and is now back after her owner could no longer take care of her. Apple is a delight to have around as she is a lot to love and has an infectious little meow giving her an endearing purrsonality. Apple is little miss independent who comes and goes as she pleases. She would love nothing more than to be given some space to her own and to be pampered like the princess she is.

Apple is a quiet lady who loves to bask in the sunlight and would certainly benefit from someone to help play with her and give her some exercise! She's ripe for the picking and ready to charm any adopter with her flirty ways and eye-catching looks, come and meet our delightful Apple today!"
459,"Meet our newest pretty lady to arrive at the Animal Care League, PadmÃ©! This gorgeous gal was brought came in to the shelter as part of a transfer from a high intake facility and instantly won us over with her flirtatious ways and endearing purrsonality! PadmÃ© has been well adjusted to her surroundings as well as people, as she is tolerant with handling and is outgoing with her chirpiness and affection. She's a young girl at heart who enjoys to romp around and play as well as being easily won over with some treats! PadmÃ© is fit to be a queen as she loves getting pampered and shown attention, which is why she may be able to coexist with other pets but doesn't mind being the only feline to rule the roost! PadmÃ© would also do just fine being in a home with children of all ages, she has a lot of love to give and wouldn't mind little ones to treat her like royalty! PadmÃ© spent some time in a wonderful foster home where she seemed very interested in other felines and would prefer being in a home with no dogs. She's quite the charmer with her luxurious coat and delightful demeanor, which is why she would add much love, entertainment, and joy to any household! Come on by ACL to meet this love-bug!"
460,"We have an amazingly sweet little rabbit on our hands in Noodle! This ravishing rabbit was surrendered to our shelter and is now looking for her furrever home where she can hop around and shower her new hooman companion(s) with love! Noodle is very curious about everything and anything around her and seems to enjoy the company of other rabbits too! When she is out and about, she love to explore at her own pace, she'll certainly benefit from some TLC to help boost her confidence to help heradjust to her surroundings. This fun floppy friend needs an understanding caretaker to help socialize, but she opens up quickly and definitely loves attention!

Primrose is happy and hoppy as can be and is sure to entertain you with her luxurious looks and delightful demeanor. is a very curious and independent bunny. She loves to investigate her surroundings! After she's been out of her cage for awhile, Primrose will give a few binkies around the room and will come sniff her visitors. Primrose is still learning to socialize with humans and needs to go to a bunny-savvy home with older, respectful children and adopters who understand it will take time and patience for her to settle in. She may never be a lap bunny but she's sure to make a nice companion for someone looking for a bunny buddy to share their space with! Primrose may have the potential to live with other buns provided she is given a proper introduction but is sure to provide your home with liveliness and fun! Come on by to meet this lovely lady and fall in love with the beauty that is Primrose!"
462,"Get your camera out - this cat is ready for his glamour shot! Cam is a luscious and stunning young black cat with the shining fur and emerald eyes of a panther! He came to ACL from a local animal control where he had been surrendered when his owners lost their home. Cam spent some time in a foster home, and his foster mom says he was a blast! Our handsome boy was adopted out and unfortunately returned after the family discovered they were allergic. He is now looking for his furrever home and is hoping to bounce his way into one soon! Cam loves loves loves to play fetch - he will fetch and retrieve little foil balls all day long if you let him. He carries them in his mouth, too! Cam is almost more dog than cat! He coexisted with a gentle chihuahua in his foster home with no trouble, so he'll do ok with an easygoing dog who isn't in his face too much. He lived with other cats previously, and he also didn't mind. Cam is more of an adventurer and play partner than a snuggler - he'd absolutely adore a home that had lots of time for laser play, catnip mice, and fetch fetch fetch! Cam would do well in a cat-savvy household with older, respectful children who can provide him with lots of enrichment and space to his own! Come on by the shelter to meet this stud muffin!"
463,"Beefy, juicy, and delicious - that's our Brisket! He's an 11 month old American Staffordshire Terrier puppy who is just the cutest meatball you've ever met. He arrived at ACL as a baby puppy when we was just a month old - he had been found outside and rescued by a police officer! Brisket was adopted, but sadly the other dog in his home was not interested in his puppy shenanigans, and now he's back at ACL looking for his forever. Brisket loves people and other dogs, and he just wants to play play play all day! He's in his mouthy puppy phase, so he needs a hearty adopter who is excited to teach Brisket all the things he needs to learn to be a well-adjusted adult. Brisket would shine in a home with a resident dog that equals his puppy energy and has a tolerant nature. Brisket can be slow to recognize cues of irritation from other dogs, so an understanding dog friend is key! Brisket will do best in an adult home who understand that strong teenage puppies like to use their mouths to play! We also ask that Brisket enroll in A Sound Beginning training program at the time of adoption to ensure he receives the basic training he needs to be successful. You can read more about ASB at asoundbeginningprogram.com. Please email Gabrielle for more info at caninemanager@animalcareleague.org!"
464,"Just like the hero of The Neverending Story, our Bastian is ready to face whatever adventure comes his way! He's a super friendly, happy-go-lucky 18 month old Kelpie/hound mix who is the perfect size at 30 pounds. He's a friendly, affectionate guy who enjoys the company of humans and other dogs. He's only too happy to give you a big kiss and hug as soon as you meet him! Bastian is excellent with other dogs, and his life is made much better by being part of a ""pack."" We are requiring that Bastian go to a home with another playful dog in order to guarantee he transitions well into his new life. He's a young guy, so Bastian still likes to chew, play, and get into mischief. He also likes to herd people a bit! Bastian would do well with some basic training and fun stuff to do to work off some of his excess puppy energy. We think with regular exercise and some training, he'd be a great dog for kids 10 and up. Because of his herding instinct, no cats please!"
465,"We have an abundance of beauty to behold here at the Animal Care League and Mimi is a helpful contributor for that! Mimi was originally a little stray kitten that was transferred in to our shelter and is now back as an adult after her owners could no longer take care of her. Mimi is as sweet as can be and just loves being pampered like the princess she is! She's an independent lady who prefers her own space and will come/go as she pleases. Mimi enjoys her pets and TLC when she wants, and although she isn't quite the cuddle bug, she's still very flirty with her chattiness and gorgeous looks! Mimi would do best in a household with older children that can give her time and space to her own. She certainly wouldn't mind being the only pet in her household either as she is the Queen of the castle! Mimi has been a great girl to have around ACL, which is why we didn't hesitate to go above and beyond for her, as we would for all of our furr babies! Mimi received some dental work while in our care helping pave the way to go home happy with clean, pearly whites! Mimi is now ready to find her furrever home and is hoping you will be the one to treat this lady with endless love! She is currently basking in the pleasure of being in a foster home while awaiting her furrever home. 
If you are interested in meeting Mimi, contact Alan at felinemanager@animalcareleague.org for more in-furr-mation!"
466,"Mama Mia! You've never met a mama as dedicated and patient as our mama China. This lovely lady tabby was surrendered to animal control when she unexpectedly gave birth to 8 (yes 8!) kittens and the family couldn't keep them all. ACL took China and her brood in, and a loving foster family spent the several months helping China get her babies healthy and big enough for adoption. You can't imagine how exhausting it was for China to be such a good mom to 8 little ones, but boy did she handle it all with grace and poise! The time finally came when China found a home that helped dote on her the same way she doted on her babies and unfortunately China came back after her owners had to move where pets weren't allowed. China deserves to be someone's princess with her sweet disposition and adorable little face! China is an affectionate cat who can be a little skittish with other cats and is definitely not interested in living with dogs. She's a super playful lady when the mood strikes her, so she'd love a home that wants to play with her every day! After play time ends, she wants to snuggle up on your lap or lay by the window and watch the world go by. China is a rough and tumble play partner, so she'll do best with previous cat owners and older, respectful children. Our wide-eyed little girl is awaiting her furrever home, come meet China today!"
467,"CeeCee is a 4 year old Shih Tzu/Yorkie mix with a lot of energy and zest for life. She's a spunky girl who came to ACL as a stray and quickly made a lot of friends. CeeCee has a jaunty walk - it's more of a prance! - and she's a vocal girl who's always talking with you. CeeCee is a nervous girl who needs a home with an experienced owner who doesn't mind being patient with her as she learns to trust and relax. She's very affectionate and playful, but she can be territorial and guards her people and house from strangers. Her adopters will need to be patient with her as she adjusts and give her a calm, firm, confident hand. CeeCee is not comfortable with cats, and she is available for adult homes with previous dog experience only. She is looking ideally for a home with a single woman - that's her preference! - or two people max where she can really bond and settle in. Because of CeeCee's intermittent anxiety, she has a required enrollment in ""A Sound Beginning"" training program at the time of adoption to help her new family bond with her. See asoundbeginningprogram.com for more info on this training program! Please email Gabrielle at caninemanager@animalcareleague.org if you think you and CeeCee could be besties!"

Meet Queso, a delightful Dutch rabbit that arrived at the Animal Care League as part of a transfer from another facility and is now hoping to find his forever home! Queso can be very curious about everything and anything around him! This little boy enjoys his peace and quiet and can usually be found relaxing in his little hidey-box or chompin' on his hay! Queso took a little bit of time to warm up and adjust here at Animal Care League, but after some socializing and pampering, he began to trust us in no time! Queso may have the potential to live with children of all ages provided he is given some quiet time to help him acclimate. He would be a perfect addition for someone looking to pamper and spoil their bunny! With some TLC, Queso can learn to be a cuddly rabbit and he loves to be with you just to hang out and explore. He is very fond of his greens, some good leafy greens is the way to Queso's heart! Come by the shelter to meet our lovely friend and add some flavor to your home with our delightful Queso!"
469,"There's a lot of love to go around with our newest charmer here at the Animal Care League in Amanda! Meet our newest furry friend available for adoption that was brought into our shelter years ago as a kitten and unfortunately was returned after after her owner could no longer provide the time to care for her. Amanda  is now looking for his furrever home and we cant say enough about our sweet lady.This darling diva would thrive well in a quieter/calmer household with older, respectful children that can give her time to warm up and adjust to her surroundings. She loves being petted and pampered, both of which she rightfully deserves. She would also do well with another animal that can respect her space and not be too overbearing for Amanda, who deserves to be the queen of the castle! This beautiful baby has a lot to offer and will undoubtedly provide a home with comfort, joy, and  endless smiles! If you're looking for a stunning, easy going lady to melt your heart, then come to ACL and meet our beautiful baby Amanda!"
470,"Amicus lives up to his name - he just wants to be your friend! This beautiful, easygoing tux kitty is a young feline at heart. He originally came to ACL after his owner passed away suddenly and after having spent some time in an adopted home, he is back at the shelter because his owner was losing her home. Poor Amicus was heartbroken for a few days, but he's adjusted well to all the love coming his way, and he's ready to find a home for the second half of his life. Amicus lived in his past home with his buddy, Hugo, they're friends who are both ready for their furrever homes! Amicus is an affectionate boy who will rub and purr for your attention. He's happy to lay in the sun and watch the world go by, so we think he'd be a great addition to a quiet home or a home that doesn't have time to entertain a crazy kitten! He loves to be pet and talked to - it's clear that Amicus has been well-loved! He lived happily with another cat in both his past homes, and we believe Amicus would be able to coexist with another fine feline in his new home. He'll do fine with gentle kids of all ages. Please help us find Amicus the friend he so greatly deserves!"
471,"If you are looking for a gorgeous, elegant feline full of charm and delight, then Phyllis is the lady for you! This endearing sweetheart came in to the Animal Care League as as stray but is now ready for her furrever home. Phyllis is a kind-hearted cat who needs a patient and loving owner to help provide her with lots of TLC and pampering that she rightfully deserves. Phyllis takes some time to warm up and adjust to her surroundings but, once she does, she becomes an flirty and sweet furry baby with some kitty rubs and nose boops! Phyllis would love to find herself in a quiet, tranquil household that can help her feel comfortable and content, making her a suitable sweetheart to live with older, respectful children. Although we don't have much history on our stunning lady, she would most likely be content being treated as a solitary pet, after all, she deserves to be treated like a queen with her luxurious locks of hair! A comfortable lap and someone to brush her floofy hair is all Phyllis needs to help feel safe and secure. She's an instant love with her looks and luxurious coat, Phyllis doesn't ask for much besides some love and affection. Come on by ACL to meet our delightful diva, Phyllis, today!"
472,"Sweet, loving Mason has been waiting for just the right family - he's been waiting for YOU! Mason is an extremely handsome 2 year old English Staffordshire Terrier mix who is stocky and wrinkly in all the right places. Mason came to ACL as a stray, and sadly, his original family was never located. After a stressful first few days, Mason figured out that we were here to help him, and the rest was history! He stole all of our hearts and hasn't given them back yet! Mason is a friendly, loving guy who is eager to learn. We think of him as a boat in search of a harbor - it is clear that Mason needs a family that he can truly trust and commit himself to. Mason is well-mannered, housebroken, and easy to train. Mason's only special request is that he be the only animal in the family - he is not comfortable with other pets, and he needs a family that wants to dedicate themselves to one special pup like him. Mason will do best in homes with kids 16 and up. Please email Gabrielle to set up an appointment to meet this handsome angel!"
473,"Party on, Avi! This 2 year old Chow Chow/German Shepherd mix is all party, all the time! Avi came to ACL from a local animal control facility where he had been surrendered when his owners moved. Avi is an active, smart, busy guy who always like to be in the middle of the action. Like many similar breeds, Avi likes to have lots of room to run and lots of fun things to do. He doesn't like being bored! Avi's claim to fame is that he's amazing with other dogs - tolerant, friendly, and a goofball. He will be amazing as a second dog to a playful companion. Avi is not a good fit for homes with cats or children, but he'll be perfect for an active home that wants a running buddy and a dog who will enjoy training as much as they will! Avi is a great option for further training classes like agility or flyball - it would be so fun to see Avi flying through the air! Come meet him today! Avi has had a DNA test done, and he is a mix of Chow Chow, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, and American Staffordshire Terrier, among other breeds."
474,"Meet Skippy, an adorable, devoted Cattle Dog sure to make your heart skip a beat! Skippy is 6 years old, and he was returned to the shelter after being adopted when he was just a puppy. Skippy was a loyal, well-behaved, affectionate companion for many years, but sadly the addition of two children in the recent past caused Skippy too much anxiety, and it was not longer the best home for him. Skippy is a great guy - pretty mellow, easy to please, and totally in love with people. He longs to be the constant companion of a quiet, adult-only family where he can spend most of his time following his people around the house, going for walks with them, and laying at their feet at night. Skippy is ok with other dogs after an appropriate introduction, but he has a prey drive that makes him a poor fit for home with cats or small animals.

475,"Maribel is one marvelous belle! She's a 1 year old buff colored chihuahua mix with the most soulful eyes and a sweet disposition. Maribel came to ACL as a stray, and at first all she would do is shake and shiver in her kennel. With just a little kindness from our staff, Maribel started to snuggle up to people and it was clear she was looking for a safe port in the storm. Maribel went to a lovely foster home so she could relax a little, and she just blossomed! Maribel is a sweet, devoted little girl who loves to snuggle and be with her people. She's almost totally housebroken, and she loves to settle in for some TV time with the fam. Maribel has done well with dogs in her current foster home, and she likely would be good with kitties, too! She still has the tendency to be a little skittish with strangers and in loud environments, so a quieter home with kids 12 and up is the right fit for her. Miss Maribel is living happily in foster care, so if you think she could be the right fit for you, email Gabrielle at caninemanager@animalcareleague.org for more info on meeting her!"

477,"Hi! My name is Riley and Iâm looking for a  special forever home. My foster family has some particular requirements so that my next home is my final home! 

Iâm about 2 years old and was given up by my former family because they said there were too many dogs in my house. I was surrendered with my brother who I was very attached to. He was adopted separately, and Iâve been learning to find my independence.

I went through a few foster homes because I have a lot of energy and I didnât handle meeting lots of new people very well. I need a lot of exercise and direction. My foster family says I need a home with GSD experience and a fenced in yard, preferably a privacy fence. I thrive on structure, guidance and a routine. I need you to tell me what is okay and what is not okay. With consistency and time youâll see how amazing I can really be!!

I like to play with other dogs and would love an active brother to play with. I have two foster brothers now that I really love! Iâve been around cats my whole life and young children, though Iâd do best with older children in my forever home so they can be consistent with my training as well. 

I am crate trained, know commands like sit, down, heel and a place command for when you need me to not move for half a second (my foster family likes to joke every day is Groundhog Day!). Iâve been working on my off leash obedience as well. 

My foster family loves me so much they are open to meeting with potential adopters and working some training sessions so you can better understand how I learn. It will take me some time to warm up to a new family because itâs scary when youâve lost your home and never experienced much outside of it. 

I love to go for walks, play fetch, and Iâm food motivated! I think I have a lot of great qualities but I know Iâm not perfect. If you think youâd be willing to provide the special home I need, please apply at www.gsrescue1.org

547,"Bubbles is a silly and super-affectionate tabby girl who has stolen our hearts! She loves belly rubs, giving kisses, playing with her string toy, and snuggling in a big pile of blankets. Not all cats will come over on command like Bubbles, but this queen of cozy just loves attention from her humans! Her funniest quirk is her habit of brushing herself- all she needs is a hand to hold the brush and she will take it from there! Bubbles and sister Bijou are seeking a new forever home after their previous owner moved out of the country.

548,"Our gorgeous Margeaux is a girl who knows what she wants! Although cats typically enjoy the company of a feline companion, Margeaux has told us that she prefers to run a household solo. Of course, spend some time with this luscious girl, and she'll convince you that she's enough feline for any home!

(And thank goodness, Adeline was still sitting under the same bush when we came looking for her!)  Adeline couldn't have been happier with this turn of events, and she looks forward to a future as someone's beloved pet and family member.  Super friendly, uber playful, and undeniably affectionate, our Adeline is most assuredly one of the sweetest cats in existence!

553,"The Thunderdomes are here! These 3 boys (Knox, Sprocket, and Little Chief) were born with eyelids that didnât fully cover their eyes.  They required surgery that entailed skin grafts to help extend those lids and prevent eyelashes from irritating their eyes.  The surgery was successful, and the boys have fully functioning eyelids that cover their eyes, and eyelashes that no longer rub their eyes!  The condition they were born with also typically impairs their eyesight to some degree.  All these boys can see, but were they humans, they would need glasses!  (In some cases, fyi, the kittens can be blind, but not these boys!)

Little Chief here is the cuddler of the bunch! He adores being held and snuggled, and will sit with you as long as you like! He loves his brothers, and would love to be adopted with one (or both) of them!

Less than 24 hours after we received her, Godiva went into labor.  Unfortunately, Godiva wasn't able to care for her kittens, and they didn't  survive.  But sad as her story began with CCR,  Godiva's new lease on life also began  the day she arrived.  Within days, Godiva's health improved.  She is now the picture of health, with a shiny, sleek coat. This young girl is extremely playful, and she is wonderful with other cats (as well as people).  If you'd like to meet Godiva, please use the contact information listed below!

558,"Doe might actually be a human in a gorgeous pittie body. She is the fourth amigo in her foster family, along with her three human foster brothers. She comforts them after a nightmare, cuddles and stays up late watching TV, and is an exceptional hiding spot during games of hide-and-seek. She asks for so little in return--maybe just some belly rubs, a warm lap, peanut-butter-filled Kongs, and the occasional toy dinosaur.

Smiley and well-mannered, Doe loves training. Exercise is a key part of her day, and her foster family has even started organizing scavenger hunts around the house so she can run around searching for treats.

Itâs hard not to get excited when Doe gets excited. Sheâs got that natural charisma that makes her a great companion--and role model--for kids and adults alike.

Will you be the human for this little dear?

What ALIVE volunteers say about me:

âEvery child needs a Doe. (And grown-ups, too.)â

âNothing better than Doe cuddles on a cold winter day.â

565,"Hi, I'm Norah! I came to ALIVE with my sister, Caroline, after we were found as strays. My foster mom says that I can be a little reserved, and I like to watch a new situation for a while before jumping in. I dream of being a true companion to a family. I love to watch tv with my people, hang out next to them while they do work, watch them do yard work and my absolute favorite, snuggle with them! When I am resting and I think they are coming to pet me, my tail starts pounding slowly, then as they get closer it goes a bit faster and then POW, I just can't help wagging it full speed while my belly gets rubbed. I am 50 pounds of snuggly love. 

I love to learn new skills because I love food. Chicken is my favorite! I know how to sit, lay down, wait, touch, make eye contact, stay, shake and I am working on a few more behaviors. I love kids. They are so much fun. My foster kid will toss stuffed, squeaky  toys to me and I can catch them in the air! She loves that. I am very good about not eating her human toys. 

I do not enjoy bad weather. I like to go potty right away on all walks, but especially if it is raining or cold - then rush back inside for more snuggles. But on a beautiful day, I do love to sniff all around the neighborhood. So many interesting smells out there!

I spend my days chasing after pingpong balls, rolling in piles of catnip, and getting chin scratches from the people I trust the most. I also love to cuddle up for a good nap on the nearest cozy blanket, or if you're very lucky and give me the time I need to trust you, I'll cozy up right next to you on the sofa while you're writing a Facebook post about how wonderful I am. I am a very sophisticated lady who would prefer a forever home with kitty-savvy adults and no small children.

She is currently living in our cat room and has been using the litterbox with us.

Alaska is considered to have some special needs due to her separation anxiety. She is looking for a home with someone who is retired or a family where one person does not work and is home a lot.

Mama Carmella has been through so much and deserves a loving home. She found herself pregnant and stray and had to have her babies outdoors. She was picked up by animal control when her 3 babies were about 3 weeks old. As luck would have it, 2 orphan, 1 week old kittens were brought to animal control on the same day. They needed a mom to increase their chance of surviving. Mama Carmella took them under her wing, no questions asked. The family sat for a week at animal control awaiting rescue and got very sick in the process. Luck was on their side, a foster home was found. Fast forward 3 weeks, this family is healthy and ready to find the homes they deserve.

Meet IZZY!  This sweetie-pie is a 1 year old (approximately), female, 45 lb, Pointer / Lab / Terrier mix (just a guess).  One of our volunteers found her as a stray and when no one claimed this beautiful girl, we brought her under our wing.  Izzy is absolutely precious!!  She has stunning hazel eyes, a super cute pink nose, and adorable ""rose-type"" ears.  And what a wonderful personality!  She is  soooooooo sweet with the softest disposition!  Izzy is young and puppy-like with a very happy attitude.  It's almost like she is cracking jokes to herself all the time.  Izzy is good with other dogs and friendly with people.  She knows only ""sit"", but she is super smart and eager to learn.  We are sure Izzy will be a star!  Izzy is easy on a leash and likes to stay close.  She is looking for a semi-active family to match her youthful energy, but she is actually quite chill, too.  Long walks by the lake or striding through neighborhoods with Izzy will have heads turning not to mention the fun you will have with her!  Izzy is very loving, as well, and will make a great snuggle partner.  She literally melts right into you. SO PRECIOUS!!  She will melt your heart.  We guarantee you won't be able to resist her...!

He likes to be in charge always watching over ""his foster empire"" and particular his foster sister Louise that all are ok and content. But unlike his name, Stone is a real feline soft ball that will melt your heart the first minute you meet him. When the time is right, he let you know with head butts and deep purring sounds that he is ready for love and affection ,sitting next to you demanding being petted or  even flipping over and showing his belly to emphasize his gratitude to be safe and inside!

Please meet our beautiful ANGELINA - A true Feline Furball with a SPARK! 
This under 1 year old gorgeous kitty was found abandoned in a parking lot and, when approached by her rescuer, she alerted him with a tiny meow that she was desperate to get inside and of course her rescuer didn't hesitate one second to do exactly this. 

This kitty was clearly exhausted beyond belief looking for a safe place to sleep and made endless power naps in her foster home. After she felt safe and settled in comfortably, it soon became very apparent how much affection and sparkly character was hidden under her a bit reserved demeanor! 

Angelina is a real funny furball, goofy and energetic, super playful chasing balls and mousies and amusing herself endlessly with bottle corks (red wine preferred) batting them back and forth. She loves other kitties and is running with her foster siblings around and playing hide and seek as well as rubbing against them to show her love. All she wants is fun, fun, fun but also love and attention. When the time is right, she will come up to you and encourage you tenderly with her head and begging with her golden eyes to be loved, petted and feeling safe showing her true affection to you. Her favorite place is sitting next to her foster mom on her favorite chair watching TV with her and patiently waiting that she will give her some more attention during commercials. 

Her foster mom's heart is always filled with pride and joy how much Angelina developed into such a happy and affectionate young sparkling teenager, and surely she will melt your heart with her gentle demeanor and soul the first time you meet her . 

Please see more pictures at: https://www.allpaws.com/adopt-a-cat/domestic-short-hair-mix-tabby/5878810

Angelina is an under one year old, healthy kitty, fully vetted including spayed, dewormed / deflead, , vaccinated, tested  negative for FIV/FELV and microchipped.

The NYCFCI is not fostering this cat and cannot process adoption applications.

This little lover boy KEANU was dumped in a community garden and immediately running up to his rescuer to ensure with the sweetest meow he is ready for a life back inside showing his tenderness and friendlyness clearly apparent. His cute face markings are giving him the purrfect finish to a true feline companion!
This loving and fun furball is that kind of feline soul that will look you straight into your eyes while being petted, will  try to give kisses and will show his deepest gratitude with an immense purring and belly exposing that you are paying attention to him and giving him a little piece of your heart. He will head-butt your extended hand every chance he get, giving paws and  expressing his joy, contentment and affection to his human buddy. 
KEANU is a true personal assistant that will welcome you at the door, circling around your legs letting you know how much he missed you and will enjoy playtime and attention to the fullest. He enjoys conversations and will always respond when you speak to him. At any time he is ready for playing and goofing around, but also likes to snuggle up and hang out on the couch watching tv with you. He also enjoys being picked up if it means he will get even more attention and love. And if he thinks you are really busy with something else he may climb on your shoulder - just making sure you don't forget him. We can only imagine what a loving affectionate boy he will be in his future furever home!  

Please see more pictures at: https://www.allpaws.com/adopt-a-cat/domestic-short-hair/6727960

KEANU is a very easygoing, energetic and very playful feline fellow that really needs a playmate (would do well with a younger cat or kitten) to be completely happy! During his adventures in his future furever home he would love to have a furry partner in crime  that is not scared by a little bit of a mischievous troublemaker bouncing around.

He is about  2 year young, tested negative for FIV/FeLV and any parasites, neutered, fully vaccinated and microchipped!
Please don't hesitate to inquire about this very handsome and sweet boy who is so deserving of wonderful new life; maybe with you?

Hi I'm THE GREAT GATSBY- The cutest Lover Boy and BEST KISSER in Town! 
This adorable boy must have been recently abandoned by his owner who left him behind in a community garden where we maintain a feral cat colony. One of our rescuers immediately spotted him as he was anxiously meowing to get some food in his starving belly and almost screaming : please don't leave me here - I don't know where to go besides hiding in a winter shelter!"" Of course, she didn't hesitate a second to get this sweet boy off the street, tucked him into a carrier and brought him inside. 
Gatsby immediately settled into his warm and cosy condo truly exhausted but so grateful to be safe inside and taking power naps with the deepest purring sound and buiscuiting while dreaming - making him one of the most adorable kitties - especially with his cute little goatee spot under his chin!
Right away, Gatsby made also sure we knew that he is a TRUE LOVER BOY! He meows to greet you when entering the room, rubs against you and starts purring loudly and follows you until you pet him!  Once you start petting him, he will roll around on his back and demanding with his beautiful green eyes intensive belly rubs! 
We can honestly state that GATSBY is one of these rare special kitties that we call ""BORN TO BE A LOVER BOY"".  He is a super affectionate feline companion:  always ready for attention, petting and cuddle time. He has as profession ""Personal Assistant"" on his business card: always curious to know what his ""human buddy"" is doing and how he can assist him/her night and day! 

When satisfied he will thank her love and affection with a smile and kisses - YES, LOVER BOY GATSBY is a GREAT KISSER as well!! Nothing makes him more happy than to be with someone and that someone is finally there for him - as much as possible!
Of course as a young teenager, Gatsby can be very playful batting his mousy around and after enough playtime hanging out on the highest platform of the cat tree!

https://youtu.be/hODYqzAmPtc

Gatsby has been in a foster home with other cats and a dog and has been doing ok with them. But as he always wants to come first he would need a furry companion that is more laid back and can stand up for itself, thus he would be certainly great as the only feline king in his future home with lots of love,  attention and playtime .

SEE MORE PICTURES AT: https://www.allpaws.com/adopt-a-cat/domestic-short-hair/8057977

Gatsby is under one year old boy, already neutered, dewormed/deflead, tested negative for FIV/FELV, fully vetted with all vaccinations and microchipped. 
Come and meet this affectionate and handsome snuggler, who's personality is more beautiful in life than pictures can tell and you will feel like kissed by the Charming Lover Boy Gatsby when he puts his head in your hand seeking for fun and love !

Teddy, aka âTeddykinsâ, âThe Tedsterâ, is a handsome 7 month old brown tabby/white mix.  His exotic green/yellow/brown eyes are lined like those of an Egyptian prince.  Being a kitten, he is very energetic and playful.  He loves to chase balls, a laser pointer, anything that moves.  Teddy is friendly and affectionate, he is a super sweet snuggle bug in the making.  He loves to reach up with his face and give you kisses.  Teddy gets along well with other cats.  Being the Don Juan that he is, he especially loves older female cats.  Teddy is a very lucky kitten as he was humanely trapped on a cold winter night after he crossed Broadway on his way to Dunkin Donuts.  Teddy lacked human contact for the first few weeks of his life, but he made an amazingly quick adjustment to his caretakers.  He is now ready for his forever home.  Like many of his generation, Teddy requires a grain-free diet.  Teddy is neutered, vaccinated, FIV/FeLV negative, and microchipped.  This real live Teddy bear is waiting to go home with you and share his love!

If you like to gamble and you are feeling lucky, you canât lose with Blackjack and Domino.  Domino is a big bundle of love; he is an extremely friendly cat who adapts quickly to new environments.  The giant black splotch on his nose and bent ear make him even more unique and endearing.  When Domino was rescued he was suffering from ear mites.   The vet said that his constant scratching caused a hematoma which caused his ear to collapse.  The occurred some time ago.  Blackjack, a stunning tuxedo with big green eyes and a gorgeous white ruff, is more introspective.  His loving nature will emerge as he gets to know you.  He gets jealous when Domino is being pet and demands equal attention!!   They are both loving, calm, and gentle cats.  Blackjack and Domino are most likely brothers, approximately 5 years old.  It appears that these wonderful cats were cruelly abandoned by their owner, as they were already neutered when rescued.  They were discovered living behind an HVAC unit of a building on the Upper West Side.  Several residents were feeding them, but the smell of the food entered a business through the HVAC and their presence was threatened.  They were rescued just in time, the odds were definitely in their favor.  Since their rescue they have been evaluated by a vet and given clean bills of health.  They were given all vaccinations and are FIV/FeLV negative.  Blackjack has been microchipped.  You hit the jackpot when you adopt these winning cats!!

These lively sisters were rescued from a rooftop den when they were 4 weeks old. They tamed up into cuddly little pets and are robustly healthy from drinking plenty of mother's milk. 

Maggie has the wide white blaze on her face and is still the more adventurous one -- she was the first one to let herself be plucked out of the roof. Tennessee has the little white ""mustache"" and has become quite a cuddler. They're still young and learning ""cat manners,"" so ideally they should be either adopted together or into a home with at least one other cat/kitten.

The girls have been socialized to the human world by 3 adults. They're currently also still living with their birth mother, and they've interacted successfully with a small dog, other cats, and small children. They're spayed, tested negative for FIV/FeLV, and up-to-date on FVRCP vaccinations. 

If you want to meet them, Maggie and Tennessee are in Downtown Jersey City."

Stunning tabby âmooâ cat Duchess was found in front of a grocery store playing with a weed wrapper, right by the road!  She came to greet her rescuers and even let them carry her home without complaint, purring the whole way!  They decided she is just TOO friendly to survive the mean lonely streets and took her in!  She loves everyone (even strangers, guys, girls, anyone!) and is always purring.  Sheâs healthy and sleek and even has natural eyeliner!
She is a high energy girl and would do best with a family with an existing cat or another kitten so she doesnât get bored.  Duchess will play non-stop and is very entertaining to watch!  She makes very cute (albeit strange/crazy) meows and absolutely LOVES playing peek-a-boo with you.  Quite a unique little character!
The trick to tiring her out is those hang-up over the door squeaky toys which she will play with for hours on end, though honestly she will play with absolutely anything.  Interactive toys are a good idea too.  After playing for a while she will happily sit on your lap and she LOVES being held.  She loves scratching posts, circuit toys (with the scratching cardboard and ball) and cushions to sprawl out on!
Due to her high energy and possible early-life neglect, âDuchyâ sometimes passion bites (like a bad baby!) though it must be noted this is not aggression just energy and immaturity on her part.  This behavior will disappear with age and gentle training and we only notice it happening when sheâs super excited and hyper but hasnât been worn out!
Duchess is not picky with food but has mostly been on grain-free wet food so she looks fantastic!
Duchess will need to be homed with another cat-friendly cat or kitten her age.  Thanks.
 
- Duchess is fixed, up to date on shots, microchipped and spayed and ready for her forever home!

This young boy with his beautiful emerald green eyes has lived his young live in a community garden and crossed our path during a TNR - his friendliness clearly apparent. 

Rusty is a STUNNINGLY beautiful fellow with amazingly green eyes, super soft fur and the most tender meow when greeting you.

No doubt, when you meet him the first time he will catch your heart with his affectionate but gentle approach and let you know: ""I know I'm going to fall in love with you - and so will you!!!

Rusty LOVES other kitties and always encourages his foster siblings with the cutest chirping sound to play and cuddle with and headbutting them, so he needs a  home that resides already a young furry playful feline family member. He always calls out for furry foster company - as he did with his siblings while still being outside - he is true feline buddy! 

Rusty is roughly 2 years young, absolutely healthy including being neutered, deflead, fully vetted, vaccinated and tested negative for FIV/FELV, and ready for his furever home.

PLEASE MEET SNOOPYDOO - A GOOFY and LOVING COMPANION!

This little young boy showed up in one of our feral colonies and got pretty beaten up by the colony cats - so we rushed to help and took him off the street. As usual, friendly and abandoned unaltered males are defenseless against the alpha behavior of feral cats, so he had to endure quite some scratches in his face and back of his head that are now treated and healing nicely 
We called him SNOOPYDOO - because of his cute black spot on his nose and also because of his cute and sparky character. He immediately showed his love to his rescuer demanding attention with his very distinct meow and making biscuits while being petted - almost saying ""thank you for getting me out of there""! 

When transferred to his foster home it didn't take SNOOPYDOO long to settle in and making himself comfortable on the bed like saying: "" Here I'm, here I'll stay - still exhausted but clearly happy to have a cozy blanket to snooze on. And he continued to be a mush ball and lover boy - always engaging with his foster Mom and following her around, joining at her work at the computer, rubbing against her legs and encouraging her to play fetch or hide and seek with him but also to get his time of petting and just being with her.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cegjywOECsA

He is such an easy going furry sweetheart that fitted right in among the feline foster gang communicating and playing with them after only a very short period of introduction - showing his goofy side. He can be a little canon ball as he loves to play hide and seek with his foster siblings, leaping around to have fun fun fun - so it would be great if he finds a furever home with a playful feline buddy. 

His other highlight to show his feline love is at bedtime (and also lazy weekend afternoon naps) where he makes sure he is right next to his foster Mom to snuggle in and getting petted to sleep. If you are looking for a fun and loving furry Dude on your side -  don't look further - A GORGEOUS feline and goofy personal assistant is waiting for YOU!.

SNOOPYDOO is 2-3 years young, absolutely healthy including being neutered, deflead, vaccinated, microchipped and tested negative for FIV/FELV, and is so ready for snuggle time in his furever home - may be yours?

The NYCFCI is not fostering this cat and cannot process adoption applications.

Sweet Sophia lived outdoors on our block in Sunset Park for 4-5 years, where she charmingly created a network of support for herself.  But the block is changing, with more traffic and construction than ever, and her old habitat completely razed.  We are now hosting her in our apartment, but I cannot keep her, for health reasons.  We are looking for a kind and patient cat person to long-term-foster and adopt her â sheâs a great gal.

Sophia is charming, highly entertaining, healthy, smart, and cute as a button.  She looks us right in the eye, and engages with us.  Sheâs been in our apartment five months, out of her crate for four, and sheâs already made much more progress than we ever expected.  She comes to greet us when we come home, and entertains us by playing with different toys and clowning around.  She gives us high-fives with her paw, touches our hands with her nose and head, and is starting to rub on our feet and legs.  She even lets us pet her if we bribe her with kitty treats, and while she still doesnât like to be fully touched, it is starting to look like she eventually will.  Itâs important to allow things to be fully on her terms so that she feels safe and secure.  

We have a male cat and Sophia gets along with him, but we do think sheâd prefer to be on her own â she can be a little territorial (and he can be a little bit of a bully).  That said, the two cats do eat, play, and hang out together.  Sophia has made up to houseguests as well, charming them and engaging with them after just a few days, which makes us think she will adapt well to a new, loving home (ideally in which sheâs the only pet).  Sheâs been to the vet, treated for worms, and tested negative for everything. She is up to date on vaccines.

Crystal (f) and Diamond (f),  gorgeous multi-colored calicos,  are extremely lucky kittens.  They were rescued from a filthy boiler room with their mother at the age of 4 weeks, where they may not have survived.  A kind soul brought these cats to his workplace, where the Superintendent is a cat lover.  The Super alerted a nearby rescuer to these cats, who then contacted my rescue.  It was difficult to determine exactly what these kittens looked like at first because they were so dirty, but baths enabled their true colors to emerge.  You can see in the pictures how filthy the bath water is from just one kitten!!
 
Now Crystal and Diamond are beautiful strong healthy kittens, approximately 5 months old.  They are both neutered, vaccinated, FIV/FeLV negative, and micro-chipped.  Crystal is slightly bigger than Diamond and has a gray âbeardâ under her chin.  They are sweet and playful, they love to chase each other around.  These kittens will keep you on your toes, there will never be a dull moment.  They may be adopted individually, but ideally they should be adopted together as they are a bonded pair.  These kittens had a difficult start in life.  Please make the rest of their lives purr-fect by providing them with forever homes!!

688,"Our magnificent Hero needs a hero of his own. This beautiful, robust boy is a victim of circumstances. His doting owner lost her home, and desperately tried to find housing to accommodate her beloved companion, whom she had raised from a pup. Hero's Mom took up temporary residence in a local motel, until she could get her bearings, but Hero was booted out by the motel manager. After a tearful goodbye, sad Hero was left in the care of a well-respected town shelter, who pled his case to us.

Hero appears to be a handsome mix of black Labrador Retriever and Border Collie. He has the physique and color of a black Lab, and the white tuxedo markings and black speckled white socks that suggest Border Collie. At 50 pounds, Hero has a solid, muscular build, and yet is easy to handle on lead. As a combination herder and retriever, Hero loves the outdoors, and has a hardwired work ethic that needs to be channeled through exercise and obedience work. 

Hero sometimes seems unsure of his place in the world, and needs to join a home with a strong pack leader, willing to provide the structure that he needs to to thrive. Hero gives the impression of caution at first, as he sizes up strangers, but warms quickly to a gentle touch. Adopters will need to be comfortable putting boundaries between Hero and strangers: he can become overzealous in guarding his person. He would be the ideal watchdog.

Hero seems subdued and intimidated at times, in the midst of our busy foster home, and we sense that a quiet, adult home would suit him best. He is not a big fan of change, and a steady, quiet routine will serve him beautifully.  Hero would be the ideal walking or running companion for an active single or couple. He loves the outdoors, can keep a brisk pace on a hike, and longs to make a one-to-one connection with a strong human personality. Hero could easily join a multi-dog home with another well-trained, calm dog, but cats are a definite no-go.

Hero has progressed nicely in his basic obedience training. The obedience work serves him as a job he can take pride in, and he performs the commands beautifully, either for praise or treats. Obedience training is key to providing the working breeds with the purpose and focus that they need to live happily in a domestic lifestyle.

Hero has good house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should have appropriate patience, and expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during Hero's transition to a new home. He is in excellent health, and is at an ideal lean body weight. He has been neutered, and has been vaccinated for Rabies, DA2PP (distemper, adrenovirus, parvo and parainfluenza), and Canine Flu. He has been boostered as needed, and has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and microchipped. If you are interested in Hero, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info. 

Eskies Online is a 501(c)(3) Multibreed rescue group that serves unwanted American Eskimos and other dogs in need. Our group of volunteer foster homes spans the North East, and our adoption territory extends from Maine to eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, and parts of northern Maryland.

689,"Our stunning Wednesday enters the room like an arctic blast of cold on a hot summer night and grabs your attention! This magnificent one and a half year old, black Labrador Retriever mix came to us from a big city Animal Control facility, where she spent some time after a lackluster owners abandoned her. She was rail thin and gaunt when she entered the city shelter system, and took some time to adjust to her harsh surroundings. 

When Wednesday came to our Rescue, she was a wild child, a Black Beauty in need of some firm, loving leadership. It was painfully obvious that her owners had missed all of her social development cues, and woefully neglected her manners and leadership training. Wednesday was as precocious as her Addams Family namesake, and seemed to feel that her opinion was warranted on just about every subject.

In no time, Wednesday has developed into a canine thoroughbred, brimming with potential. An energy and personality match is key to Wednesday's happiness. She is a high energy, athletic dog who needs alot of outdoor exercise. She would gleefully keep rigorous pace with an avid runner, hiker or powerwalker, and seems to thrive in the brisk country air. No doubt about it, Wednesday needs an active adopter, but, also one who is extremely proficient in leadership and obedience training. She is not a dog for the casual or inexperienced adopter.

Wednesday largely appears to be Labrador Retriever, but we also suspect some Border Collie in her DNA. She is a lean, tall dog weighing 47 pounds, and is extremely graceful and athletic. She runs with great speed, and could be an agility champion. Wednesday has the energy and intelligence that we see in this high strung Herding breed, as well as the mischievious and impertinent tendency that sometimes occurs when Border Collies are under exercised and bored! 

As a double dose of working dog, Wednesday definitely needs a job, and she is a natural at obedience work. She knows all her basic commands, and has passed many of the Canine Good Citizenship tests. She handles beautifully on lead, and heels nicely. Wednesday still needs some polish on her stranger manners, since she may, on occasion, greet someone rudely, but motivated adopters should be able to work her through any issues by employing her well honed commands. In the right hands, Wednesday will become a fantastic, well behaved companion.

Wednesday would fare best in an adult home, with adopters experienced in handling large, active breeds. She would overwhelm toddlers and seniors. She could easily join a multi-dog home, with another active, well trained dog, but sometimes, unruly and ill mannered dogs press her buttons. We have not had her around cats, but she would most likely chase them beyond their tolerance level.

Wednesday has respectable house manners and is mostly housetrained. She will need some finetuning on her potty routine as she transitions to a new environment. Wednesday is in good health, and has been spayed. She has been vaccinated for rabies, bordatella, and DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus). She has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been microchipped and dewormed, and is on monthly flea/tick and heartworm treatment.

If you are interested in Wednesday, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738.

Eskies Online is a 501(c)(3) Multibreed rescue group that serves unwanted American Eskimos and other dogs in need. Our group of volunteer foster homes spans the North East, and our adoption territory extends from Maine to eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, and parts of northern Maryland. Once an adopter is approved, we arrange transportation. We do not adopt dogs beyond our territory. Please visit our website: www.eskiesonline.com for more information about our group and our adoption procedures."
690,"Our Cupid is a sage soul, who found himself homeless, along with his housemate Eskie, Precious, after his family lost their residence. He entered the confines of NYC ACC, and did not fare well during the rescue process. He became shy, shut down, and suspicious of human touch, so Shelter workers directed him to us, so that we could evaluate him in a more hospitable environment.

We were happy to invite this sad soul to join us, and he has really come out of his shell in foster care. At first meeting, Cupid seems shy and reticent, but he warms quickly once he reconnects to a loving human vibe. He has adjusted beautifully to foster care, has been a joy to handle. Cupid loves people, and is generally friendly to strangers, once he warms up, but would be happiest in a quiet adult home, where he can chill out. 

Cupid would be the ideal companion to an active single, or couple, who have large dog, or Rottie experience. Powerful breeds like Rottweillers and Hounds that have a work ethic bred into their DNA, require purposeful lifestyles that challenge their mental and physical faculties. They also need a strong pack leader to teach them Canine Good Citizenship.

Cupid has excelled in his obedience work, and this is a great way for an adopter to bond with him, and continue to assume a positive leadership role. Cupid has mastered all of his basic obedience commands, and adopters will be able to get him up to speed and into their lifestyle quickly. Cupid has a moderate energy level and does not require an untoward amount of exercise. A couple of brisk leash walks each day should do the trick and keep him happy and balanced.

As an adult dog, Cupid is calm and well behaved in the house. He could easily live in an apartment or home environment, and he would be fine during an 8-hour work day. He would also be happy as the companion to an active retiree with lots of time to spend with him. We think that Cupid may be too sensitive to tolerate young children, and we have not had him around cats. He could easily join a multi-dog home, as he seems to enjoy companionship with his own kind, and has become one of the superstars in our large dog play group.

Cupid has good house manners, and is house trained, to the best of our observation, although adopters need to have realistic expectations of Rescue dogs, who may lose some of their potty Mojo and they as they go from place to place during this unwieldy process. We expect adopters to troubleshoot any housetraining issues after the fact.

Cupid is in excellent health, and has been neutered. He is vaccinated for Rabies, Parvo, adrenovirus, distemper, coronavirus, leptopirosis, canine influenza, and bordatella. He has been dewormed, and has tested negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis.

If you are interested in Cupid, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com, or call/text Denise at cell: 860-908-9738 for an adoption application.

691,"Our Epi has as grand of soul as we have ever encountered. This big, bombastic beauty is a natural born cuddler who longs to become someone's Number One. She came to us recently from NYC ACC, where overbred Bully breeds are euthanized by the hundreds before they can get an even break in life.

Epi was found as a city stray, and was taken to the Brooklyn Care Center. Despite frantic shelter life, Epi has made a remarkable impression on everyone she met. Shelter staff and volunteers agreed that Epi is spectacular, and she received the best behavior evaluations. At first it seemed likely that Epi would be reunited with her owner, but sadly no one came forward to claim her. 

We were made aware of Epi's plight and were asked to step up for her. We are so glad we did. This dog is destined to be the light of someone's life. She is an older puppy at just one year old, who's never had the benefit of any training or leadership. Her temperament is pure gold. She loves everyone, and is so full of joy, that she lights up a room when she enters.

In a culture that vilifies the Bully Breeds, Epi stands out as an ideal dog for an active family with older, teenaged kids. She is a tri-color American Staffordshire Terrier, and is a high energy dog, muscular and strong at 60 pounds. While she loves to play with kids, she will overwhelm young children. She would do best in an active home, in which she can play a prominant role, with folks who understand the ongoing importance of exercise and leadership. If Epi is neglected to the point of boredom and frustration, she will likely make mayhem.

Epi enjoys the companionship of other dogs, but is prone to rough-house play. She can easily join a multi-dog home, but energy levels must be matched and some attempt must be made to maintain calm, because rough play can bubble over into canine disagreements. We have not had her around cats, but she would definitely chase them in play beyond their tolerance.

Epi is responding beautifully to her leash training, and has calmed down quite a bit since we have established a regular routine with her. However, some physical strength is necessary to handle her on lead, and she requires a good amount of exercise to keep her calm and focused.

Epi has good house manners and loves her crate. She will benefit from ongoing obedience work, but is full of potential for the right bully breed lover. Epi has such a phenomenal temperament that she could easily coast all the way to Canine Good Citizenship Certification in the hands of motivated adopters.

Epi has decent housemanners for an older puppy, and is housetrained and crate trained. Adopters are expected to forgive a few accidents during the course of her transition to a new routine, and fine-tune the potty schedule as appropriate. Epi is in excellent health, and is recently spayed. She is up to date on routine shots, and is dewormed and microchipped. Epi has tested negative for Heartworm, Lyme, Earlichia and Anaplasmosis. If you are interested in Epi please email: denise@eskiesoline.com or call/text Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info.

692,"Our vivacious Freda has the bouyant good nature that attracts American Pit Bull Terrier folks to this lovable breed. No other breed has been so overbred, mishandled and maligned as the APBT, and we are thrilled to have Freda with us, early in her young life, so that we can find her forever home.

Three years old, Freda started off her rescue journey as a statistic: just one more homeless pit roaming the mean city streets. She has traversed the rescue process with ease, and has displayed great confidence and panache as she has interacted with everyone along the way. (Well... except the police officer who brought her to NYCACC. We hear that she was not his biggest fan, especially after he pepper- sprayed her in the eyes). Freda's shelter behavior evaluations were good, and she was adopted through the shelter adoption program to a young couple who learned quickly that Freda was not a good fit for their low key lifestyle.

NYCACC approached us on Freda's behalf, because Staff and Volunteers had fallen in love with this russet beauty, and we invited her to Connecticut. Freda has been handled with great love, and has a friendly, outgoing temperment, although, she is not a fan of rough handling. She would be a fantastic choice for a gentle bully breed lover, who is willing to continue her exercise and obedience regimen. 

Freda is high energy and needs vigorous exercise. She loves to be on the go: the more action, the better. A bored, frustrated Bully will surely make mischief, but in the hands of dedicated breed enthusiasts, who rejoice in their high energy companions, Pitties are Man's devoted BFFs.

Freda is a total stunner. She is a Red Nose, ABPT, and has twinkling greenish-hazel eyes. Her coat is a pretty reddish carmel with white tuxedo markings, and cute white socks. Freda is a strong muscular dog, and she is at an ideal weight of 50 pounds. She is a strong girl, who require some experienced handling on leash walks. Freda knows all of her basic obedience commands and handles well with assertive leadership.

We think that Freda will thrive in the active home of the experienced Bully Breed lovers, who have a basic understanding of dog behavior and obedience techniques. Freda is very responsive to training, and is both treat and praise motivated. We'd like to avoid homes with small children, since Freda is a strong dog, and may overpower toddlers.

Freda would probably do best in an only dog environment, where she can bask in her family's attention. Freda's adapters will be able to walk her easily on lead in a public place or urban environment, but she may not be an appropriate candidate for unstructured play in a public dog park. Freda likes to play rough, and rough-house play among high energy.dogs can often bubble up into a tiff or two! Freda is not a good candidate for a feline home.

Freda has been thoroughly vetted. She is spayed, and has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus), and has been boostered as needed. She has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been dewormed, and microchipped. If you are interested in Freda, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info."
693,"Our lovely Mama suffered a tortuous intake process at NYCACC, after her owner repeatedly berated her in the crowded shelter Lobby. Our shelter contact witnessed the verbal tongue-lashing and watched in horror as Mama cowered, and shook spastically throughout the entire intake. As Mama was led into the back kennel area, we were called and ask to help her.

Mama is one of those dogs who just brightens the room whenever she enters. It's amazing that such a lovely creature could be so callously abandoned at the age of ten. Mama is a grand old gal, who needs a happy retirement home to spend her golden years. She had earned stellar behavior evaluations, and was placed in the Shelter adoption program, only to be passed over because of her age. 

Although Mama was a favorite among shelter staff and volunteers, her adoption options were limited. Seems that everybody wants to experience puppy hell, and too few people appreciate the considerable benefits of having an older dog, who is well past the puppy mayhem stage. She came to our rescue so that we could cast a wide net, and find her just the right Adopter. 

Mama appears to be a pretty mix of American Foxhound with a smidge of Boxer that adds some strength to her physique. She is a lean, statuesque beauty at an athletic weight of 45 pounds. Her short, flat coat requires minimal grooming, and Mama enjoys the grooming process. Her coat mostly is white with russet brown patches, and scattered black markings on her face. Mama seems more like the elegant Boxer in personali: she seems laid back, demure, and enjoys the companionship of her people. She exudes happiness and joy.

Mama has a very genial nature. She is a sociable dog, and while she has not had much background in obedience, she has grasped the basics and seems to enjoy the training exercises. Mama is easy to walk on lead, and has a moderate exercise level. She would be happy with a few leisurely to brisk leash walks daily and a game of frisbee.

Mama would be a great choice for a moderately active single or couple, a recent retiree or senior. She could easily do well in an apartment lifestyle, and can be trusted home alone for short periods of time. Mama has excellent pack manners, and would be a great addition to a multi-dog household, perhaps as a companion to a senior dog who has lost his or her housemate. Mama is a pretty good all-around companion dog, and needs to be in an environment where her golden years will be spent as the light of someone's life, rather than considered an afterthought.

Mama has good house manners, and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during his transition to a new home. Mama is in great health and has been spayed. She has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitus, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza, coronavirus) and has been boostered as needed. She has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been dewormed, microchipped and is on preventatives for Heartworm and Flea/Tick. If you are interested in Mama, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info."
694,"Our Circles gives the impression of shyness at first, but warms quickly to a gentle touch. He must have quite the tale to tell, after having paid his dues as a big city stray. Circles came to us via our contacts at NYCACC, where he was passed over for adoption during his short window of opportunity. Nonetheless he made friends and admirers of Shelter and Vet staff.

Circles appears to be a handsome mix of Australian Cattle Dog and yellow Labrador Retriever. He has the physique and color of a yellow Lab, and the speckled markings of the Cattle Dog. Weighing 57 pounds, Circles has a solid, muscular build, and yet is easy to handle on lead. As a combination herder and retriever, Circles loves the outdoors, and has a hardwired work ethic that needs to be channeled through exercise and obedience work. 

Circles sometimes seems unsure of his place in the world, and needs to join a home with a strong pack leader, willing to provide the necessary structure that he needs to thrive. He seems subdued, and intimidated at times, and is not a good candidate for a home with small children, or a busy home with a lot of strangers coming and going. 

Circles would thrive in an adult home, with patient folks were willing to troubleshoot some stranger danger issues. He would be the ideal walking or running companion for an active single or couple. He loves the outdoors, and is greatly suited to a slow-paced country lifestyle. He can keep brisk pace on a hike, and longs to make a one-to-one connection with a strong human personality. Circles could easily join a multi-dog home with another well-trained, calm dog, but cats are a definite no-go.

Circles has progressed nicely in his basic obedience training. We've worked with him for quite a while on food and resource guarding, and he has improved greatly. Still, it's best to leave Circles alone while eating, and to feed him separately from any other dogs. The obedience work serves him as a job, he takes pride in it, and performs the commands beautifully, either for praise or treats. Obedience training is key to the providing the working breeds with the purpose and focus that they need to live happily in a domestic lifestyle.

Circles has good house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should have appropriate patience, and expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during Circles' transition to a new home. He is in excellent health, and is at an ideal lean body weight. He has been neutered, and has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptosporosis, parvo, parainfluenza, coronavirus), and Canine Flu. He has been boostered as needed, and has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and microchipped. If you are interested in Circles, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info."
695,"Our magnificent Lucio is a glorious soul, who has just found himself homeless. When Lucio was four years old, his lackluster owner acquired him from a friend, without double-checking the landlord's dog policy. Seems to us that it would be pretty hard to hide a 80 pound Rottweiler. After three months, Lucio was found out, and was given an eviction notice. His owner abandoned him to a questionable fate at the NYC ACC. 

Despite his dramatic change of fortune, Lucio held his head up high, and greeted every new change with characteristic Rottie courage. There is great majesty in this dog: his proud stature is breed standard Rottweiler, and his demeanor is completely magnanimous! Lucio is an outgoing, friendly character, who loves everybody he meets.

We were happy to invite this handsome gentleman to our Connecticut rescue, as soon as we we became aware of his predicament. He continues to wow us with his laid back friendly nature. Lucio appears to be breed standard Rottweiler. He is a large, powerful dog at 80 pounds, and is slightly underweight. He could easily fill out to 90 to 100 pounds with healthy diet and exercise. He has a muscular build, with a massive Rottweiler head and stance. He has the true Rottie black and tan colors, floppy ears and cropped tail.

At first meeting, Lucio is affectionate and loving. He has adjusted beautifully to foster care and has been a joy to handle. Lucio loves people, and is generally friendly to strangers, but could certainly be relied upon to perform his traditional Rottweiler guard dog duties. We think that Lucio would be happiest in a quiet adult home, where he can chill out after a couple of nice leash walks each day. 

Lucio could easily join a multi-dog home with other well-trained, calm dogs, in a balanced pack dynamic. He appears to be neutral in temperament, and has been observed to get along with a wide spectrum of dog personalities. He seems to enjoy the company of large and small dogs. We have not tested him with cats, but he would be a likely candidate to coexist nicely with a feline housemate.

In temperament, Lucio seems to possess the best qualities of the Rottweiler breed. He is a lovable, courageous, devoted protector. He would be the ideal K9 companion to a moderately active single, or couple, who have large dog, or Rottie experience. Powerful breeds like Rottweilers, that have a work ethic hardwired into their DNA, require purposeful lifestyles that challenge their mental and physical faculties. They also need a strong leader to teach them Canine Good Citizenship.

Obedience work is an excellent way to build a strong bond with a newly adopted rescue dog, but is also helpful in channeling a hardwired work ethic into purposeful activity. Lucio is an obedience natural, and seems to love the daily workout. He knows most of his commands, and willingly works for treats or praise. A motivated Adopter could easily take Lucio all the way to Canine Good Citizenship.

Lucio is house trained and crate trained, although adapters should expect the occasional accident or two as he transitions to a new routine. He is in excellent health, and has been neutered, and is current on routine vaccinations. He has been dewormed, and has tested negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis.

If you are interested in Lucio, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com, or call/text Denise at cell: 860-908-9738 for an adoption application."
696,"Our Big Oscar is a charismatic lovebug. For an Australian Shepherd, Oscar has a chill vibe. He joined us a few weeks ago from NYCACC where he had been put up for adoption and passed over. His owners sadly surrendered him to the shelter, due to overseas travel. Oscar was purchased as a puppy, from an Upstate New York breeder, and spent his young five years in one home. He seems to be well socialized, and generally adaptable to change.

When Oscar found himself a guest in NYCACC, he adjusted better than most and made many friends. This handsome charmer piqued the interest of our shelter contact, Jessica, who thought he'd be a good candidate for our rescue. He has adjusted beautifully to the foster care, and has sailed through the rescue process like a champ. 

Oscar seems to be an Australian Shepherd, but his lush, full coat suggest some Collie DNA. He has the stocky, muscular Aussie build, graced with pretty Collie colors, and a full mane. His coat was in shambles when he arrived, and it was necessary to shave him down to remove some of the worst mats. His beautiful, fluffy coat should grow in beautifully over the next few months. 

Oscar is a double dose of herding dog, so he definitely needs an active lifestyle and a job. Herders are hardwired to work, and if his adopters do not give Oscar a job, he will practice his herding skills within the household. A bored, frustrated herding dog is a recipe for Mayhem.

Exercise and obedience training are the keys to managing the Herding Breeds. Oscar is a moderate to high-energy dog, who would make a great running, walking or hiking partner. He's built for speed, but will adjust his pace to suit his handler. He needs at least two brisk daily leash walks, in addition to focused playtime. 

Obedience training is essential to meeting the needs of a Herding dog. Oscar already knows all of his basic obedience commands, and is on the way to earning his Canine Good Citizenship Certification. Adopters should be able to take him the rest of the way with ease. Structure and obedience work go a long way in providing Oscar the mental and physical challenges that he needs.

Oscar is best suited to an active adult home, with a dog savvy single or couple, who have the time and energy to give him his daily exercise. Tranquility and calm suit Oscar best. In a chaotic, hectic environment he becomes anxious and demonstrates herding behavior in order to maintain social order. In a calm environment, Oscar relaxes and enjoys quiet time with his people. Kids and cats may provide too much stimulation, but Oscar could easily join a multi-dog home.

Oscar has good house manners and is house trained and crate trained, although adopters should expect to troubleshoot a few accidents during his transition to a new routine. He is in excellent health and has been neutered. He has been vaccinated for Rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus), He has been boostered as needed. He has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. If you are interested in Oscar, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info."
697,"Handsome Temple is an older puppy who has had a rough start in life. He joined our rescue about two months ago, after NYC ACC Officers found him roaming in Brooklyn. When no worried owner came to claim Temple, our Shelter Liaison asked us to give him a chance in our rescue. His sweet face wore a forlorn, shellshocked expression that melted our hearts. Just one year old, Temple found himself in quite a pickle, and was not shy about expressing his opinion to Shelter Staff.

Temple was a frightened little boy when he arrived on our doorstep, and his expression revealed extreme fear and anxiety. It has been a joy to watch him relax into his daily routine and come out of the shell. Temple has reclaimed his puppyhood! As he adjusted to life at our place, we observed that other dogs were key in helping Temple find his inner puppy joy, and make the human connection.

Temple is a unique looking mixed breed, most likely with DNA roots in Parson Russell Terrier. We suspect some Beagle, as well. Lately, we have had Beaglemania, as many pack members of this comical breed have joined our Rescue. Temple has the coloring of the Parson Russell, and the stance of his Beagle ancestors. With a double dose of working dog DNA, Temple is a high energy, intelligent boy, who needs a good deal of exercise and mental stimulation.

Temple is an active dog who loves to play. He has a very docile, good natured demeanor. He would be the ideal candidate for a multi-dog home, with other calm dogs, who could help him feel his way in a new environment. Temple will greet stangers with shy reticence, but he warms nicely as the bond builds with his people. Patient adopters will be rewarded with great love and affection, as Temple learns to trust.

We think Temple would be best suited to an active single or couple with patience to let him warm up at his own pace. He is the ideal choice for folks who enjoy helping a rescue dog bounce back from rough beginnings. Certainly, he would be the ideal running, jogging or hiking companion. Temple might be frightened by toddler antics, but will blend in quickly with other dogs or cats. 

Adopters can quicken the bonding process with frequent leash walks and ongoing obedience work. Temple's vibe seems mostly Parson Russell Terrier. He has a tenacious high energy spirit that needs to be channelled into productive activity. After a high energy walk or run, Temple is ready for his obedience workout. He now knows some basic commands, and is both treat and praise motivated.

Temple is a medium size, slender dog at an ideal weight of 31 pounds, and is an appropriate size for home or apartment. Despite Beagle reputation, Temple is not much of a barker. He has good house manners, and is house trained and crate trained, although adopters should expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will occur during his transition to a new home.

Temple is in excellent health and has been recently neutered. He is vaccinated for rabies, DHLPPC, (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza, and Coronavirus and has been dewormed, and has tested negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. If you are interested in Temple, please call or text Denise at 860-908-9738, or email Denise@EskiesOnline.com for an adoption application."
698,"Our handsome boy, Foxy, will charm folks who fancy the diminutive, upstart Pomeranian breed. Ten years old, this beautiful boy wound up in an urban high kill animal shelter, where he made quick friends with shelter workers who contacted us on his behalf. We were delighted to welcome Foxy into our Rescue, and he has adapted pretty well to foster care.

Foxy came to us as a languid, lethargic boy, which struck us as odd in a typically energetic breed. We discovered that a massive ear infection had really dug in and caused him quite a bit of misery for some time. As soon his ear was treated, Foxy began to feel better, his energy level perked up, although he is one of the calmer Pomeranians that we've known.

Foxy has the usual bevy of quirks that Pomeranian folks marvel at in their tiny toughies. He is extraordinarily loving and affection to his people, but Foxy has absolutely no idea that he is an 11 pound dog. We often see a healthy dose of the Napoleon complex in Pomeranians, and Foxy is no exception. He is prone to running his mouth at dogs much larger than him.

Foxy needs the kind of adopter who will make some demands on him, and not coddle his ""to big for his britches"" shtick. Foxy needs strong leadership, and an Alpha pack leader who will continue his obedience work and exercise routine. He would be best suited to a calm, adult home, with, perhaps one or two well-trained, small dogs, so that he can socialize with other dogs in a positive environment. Foxy would not be suitable for a large bustling family, with small children. He may do well with some dog savvy cats. 

Foxy has good house manners and is house trained, and crate trained. Adopters should expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during his transition to a new home. Foxy is in optimal health, neutered, and has just had a full dental procedure, with pre-op blood work, that will serve as a baseline for adopters going forward. He has been vaccinated for rabies, DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus), and canine flu. He has been boostered as needed. He has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and is on appropriate preventatives. 

If you are interested in Foxy, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com for an adoption application, or call/text Denise at 860-908-9738."
699,"Our Mackeral is a sweet, senior Poodle mix, who came to us from NYCACC, after he had been picked up as a stray and brought to the Brooklyn Shelter. When no bereaved owner came looking for Mackerel, he was transferred to our care so that we could do the much-needed veterinary work. This poor boy was in pretty rough shape from his time on the streets.

When he arrived, he was in wretched condition, malnourished, with a terribly matted and discolored coat. The shelter did their best, but he came to us in pretty miserable shape. The shelter vet put him at about 10 years old, but after Mackeral being here, and receiving nutritional rehabilitation, vet care and grooming, our vet puts him at about 8 years old. He's definitely a senior who still has a lot of bounce in his step and love left to give.

There is a kind of Poodle charm that attracts folks to these impish characters, who have an infectious tenacity and energy. It seems to us that Mackeral has all the Poodle panache and intelligence that these breed fanciers relish. Mackeral is a petite Toy Poodle, weighing just 14 pounds, who may have a bit of Bichon Frise in his ancestry. He has a short stocky physique with floppy ears. His cream colored coat has some stains, that are the trademark of poor nutrition, but he has been professionally groomed twice, and the texture of his coat is improving with better diet.

Mackeral is a friendly guy who loves to be in the thick of the action most of the time, but then knows when to go take a good nap. He would thrive in the lifestyle of an active single or couple. He is a confident little guy, with a sweet nature, and would be a good fit for families with older children or cats. He could easily join a multi-dog home with other fun loving, energetic scamps. He loves to play, and can hold his own with a diverse dog pack.

Mackeral has good house manners, and is generally friendly to strangers. He rides well in the car, and is the kind of companion that you can take just about anywhere. He has a happy-go-lucky spirit, that adds charm and geniality to just about any situation. Mackeral is house trained and crate trained. However, adopters will need to be patient, and troubleshoot the occasional accident that may occur during his transition to a new home.

Mackeral is in good health, and has been neutered, and has had a full dental procedure recently, along with pre-op full blood work. We've done everything that needed to be done at the vet. He had a few lumps and bumps removed, all biopsied and all benign. Our vet thinks he is in pretty decent shape for a senior, and it's our experience that with ongoing good nutrition, you can bring him into optimal health, and extend his quality of life for many good years. He has been vaccinated for rabies and DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza, and coronavirus). He has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed. If you are interested in Mackeral, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738 for more info."

Marshall is smart too! As soon as he is told to go to his bed, he listens. He is a gentle boy and takes treats softly out of your hand.

Although Marshall is playful and fun, he is just as happy to curl up and sleep when he is inside. He may occasionally steal a shoe to sleep with, but he never chews it or damages it in any way. He just snuggles with it. Such a goofy boy!

Marshall is medium energy. He loves going for walks or  to romp around. He finds his favorite sticks and trots along happily bringing it on a walk. He makes doggie friends easily and loves to run and play with his new friend. He can outrun just about every dog he meets.

Also, be prepared to get lots of compliments. Marshall is quite handsome and has lots of admirers. People constantly stop us to comment on how stunning Marshall is.

Although Marshall is sweet and loving, he is an anxious boy. When he gets overly scared or overwhelmed he has snapped (strangers moving very fast or if he thinks his family is in danger).  Because of this, we are looking for a home for Marshall outside of the city, and with no small children. Marshall is great with passing everyone on the street and he loves children, but given his anxiety at new things, we think he would do best living with adults who understand him and can make him feel safe and confident. 

At the end of the day, all he just wants are belly rubs. Marshall is super lovable and just wants to please.

704,"Hi meet Molly the snuggler. 

Molly is 3 years old, 45 pounds and so super sweet. She just loves to snuggle (both with people and other dogs!)

She loves all people and is very sweet to kids. She lives in a Foster home with other dogs, and gets along great with everyone. She just loves other dogs. She gets SO excited to see another dog on the street, so she needs a parent to reminder her to mind her manners. She doesn't understand why another dog wouldn't want to play with her. 

Molly was found tied to a pole, abandoned. We think she was used for breeding. But, you would never know about her sad past. She is the waggyest and sweetest girl. She is happy, playful, and so loving. 

For more information on Molly, please email Julie@ALRcares.com and fill out an application on our website www.ALRcares.com"

710,"Nilla came into the shelter as a stray so her past is unknown. An average rated beauty, she quickly caught the attention of a foster who wanted to save her life. Unfortunately for Nilla this person would just be another who would disappoint her. Rejected by her foster for being âtoo strongâ and wanting to chase cats Nilla was moved to boarding after only being in their house for 10 minutes.

  

 Based on her evaluation at the shelter we believe that Nilla would do well with an average family who has the ability/strength to handle a large dog. No small dogs or cats please and children middle school age or older just due to her size."

He is housebroken and walks nicely on a leash although he much prefers hanging out in the backyard over going for a walk.

He is good with other dogs of his size or larger; he lives with German shepherd and another Pitbull and is very respectful of both.

Capitan has been going to professional training and has been in a group with 10 or more dogs and plays well with all. He is crate trained and house trained and never had accidents in the house. He loves people; his favorite thing is to snuggle on a couch or a bed with his human. He walks well on a leash and knows sit, shake stay, and his favorite command is to come, when he hears the command he gets so happy that somebody is calling him and runs as fast as he can. He also likes to walk on a treadmill if somebody offers him a treat for it.

The perfect family for Jake is one that has time to continue to enforce his training and make sure he gets enough exercise. No cats or small dogs please and children middle school age or older."

Archie is 5 years old, large and handsome. He plays with other dogs but has a bite history. (he is approximately 40lbs)

He was adopted from a very elderly couple. One month later in his new home, Archie bit the wife and she required stitches. His new owners dropped Archie off at the Atlantic County shelter in NJ where he was quarantined in solitary confinement for 10 days due to biting.

Archie was scheduled to be euthanized when his 10 days were up. NEBTR picked him up before that occurred. He has been with our trainer for several months and for the right person, he is available for adoption.

According to our trainer, Archie is generally a sweet soul, suffering from a lack of trust. He is looking for guidance and wants to do the right thing. His body shows signs of neglect and probably as a result, he does have some food guarding issues that need to be understood. He can be very sensitive to physical touch and feels threatened if handled wrongly. However, Archie is currently learning to accept human touch as positive. He is also working on being respectful of his humans around food and learning to ""leave it"" when told. He is very good with other dogs and has wonderful dog skills.

Archie is a classic case of a dog that needs empathy from his humans, and someone who can provide rock solid guidance and goals. The rewards will be great; he is an awesome dog with a gentle soul suffering from a lack of trust of people. In return for guidance, he will be a great companion.

No children for this boy and a fenced yard is important for him to play as he is active. He needs a confident person who can give him the time to continue his growth.

Since he is currently with our trainer, several visits will need to be scheduled prior to adoption - consideration to location is important.

Archie is currently with our trainer in Clinton, CT and his adoption fee is 450.00."
736,"This is Roman and he is estimated to be around 10 years old. He was left at a shelter with no history so he had to start over. This little guy is a total love bug and integrated seamlessly into his foster home. It was as if he was always a part of their family and pack. He is good with all people, kids and other dogs and is just an all-around well rounded pup. We believe he did live in a caring home because he doesnât show any fear, very outgoing, loves to cuddle and immediately jumped up to claim his rightful place on the couch. He was probably surrendered because of ongoing health issues that most likely stemmed from what was finally diagnosed as Cushingâs. His foster home has experience with Cushingâs so they worked hard to get him back on track. He needs a daily pill and weâll be looking for a home who can support his immune system with a high quality diet. This guy is so adorable and deserves to finally find his finally forever home. 

Roman is being fostered in Barneveld, NY and his adoption fee is $150.00.

We don't know what his story is but could only imagine that he was abandoned by someone and left alone with his brother. This must have been a confusing moment for Beaut and his brother Bitsey, but thanks to a good Samaritan who found them both they are now in good hands and waiting for their forever home. Beaut is equally shy like his brother. He does accept chin rubs and pets and seems to enjoy the company of people but still has a slight fear so it will take some time for him. He will need a family that will be calm and patient to his needs and willing to work with him. He also must go home with his equally stunning brother Bitsey as they are bonded.

He is a very shy boy who came in with his fraternal twin Beaut. They are both equally shy but do accept gentle chin rubs and love getting pets and soft touches. These two gentle giants are for sure looking for a home that will be patient and understanding to their story. They were clearly abandoned and left all alone with no one to care for them. They are genuinely sweet souls and all they need is a chance to show a gentle family their true love and companionship towards them.

He is a bold puppy, who comes to greet the foster caretaker when the crate door opens.  He enjoys play fighting with his siblings (3 other males, 2 females).  He was found as a stray in the South.  His mom, who was only 9 months old, had 8 puppies.  Two died.  They were born in a rocky area where there were copperheads, so it is unknown if they died because the mom left, they were compromised in some basic way, or if a snake bit them.

768,"All puppies are cute and cuddly, right? We agree! But there's nothing...NOTHING...like the sweet soul of a senior dog! Coal, a 13-year old, 25-pound, Labrador/ terrier mix is a lot like your favorite pair of old, broken-in shoes: Cozy, comfy and irreplaceable. A new pair would NEVER feel quite the same!

Coal has been around the block so to speak, and guess what? He STILL loves to go around the block! Leash this fella up and he'll excitedly accompany you on a stroll through the 'hood, sniffing and greeting creatures along the way!

At home, he is content to sit with you on the couch (by invitation only!) or find a soft warm dog bed to plop down on. He is not separation anxiety-ridden, in-your-face kinda guy! Nice, huh? This easy-going cutie-pie has a healthy appetite, pretty much eats anything and is particularly fond of treats. Feed me, feed me, feed me! Oh, and guess what? He's also housebroken...yay!..and pad-trained too...double yay! He does not act his age and has energy! He knows simple commands such as sit and come. Coal will do best with a patient owner that understands he needs to build up trust. 

Coal does not hear as well as he did when he was a younger lad, but he navigates his world like a champ and only asks that you approach him gently so as not to startle him. He enjoys a tender touch, he hardly barks, sleeps through the night, can co-exist with other respectful dogs and isn't much of a shedder. 

Coal isn't some old, sooty, dirty, fossil fuel...nope, nope, nope! He's a sweet, floppy-eared, adorable, black-and-silver coated senior gentleman who deserves a low-key retirement home where he can hang his hat and enjoy some serious lovin'!

770,"If ladies can be handsome, then Juniper fits the bill! This fetching blonde is a 3-year old, 61-pound Labrador/Hound mix who is fully housebroken and wildly affectionate. 

Juniper is an active, on-the-go gal who likes to walk, play, run and have fun. And then play some more! She loves being outside, displays exuberance when itâs time for a walk, is friendly toward passersby out on the street, and is an eager travel buddy if the offer exists. 

Juniper craves a lot of devotion and physical contact, and although sheâs not much of a barker, sheâll make her wishes clear and wonât leave you guessing at what she wants! ;-) While she does quite well while left alone, Juniper is a true people dog who yearns to be with/near her human(s) as much as possible. This spirited lab is responsive to treats, will sit when asked to do so, and is good in her crate when quiet time is requested. What a girl!

Oscar is a total gem. He is dog-friendly, oblivious to cats, and wonderful around gentle humans of all ages.  He is cute, cuddly, and quiet.

Buddy is a tad timid at first, but once he knows you, his love is pure, heartfelt and unconditional. He gets along beautifully with all dogs. And all humans too! Especially if you gently caress his big, floppy, velvety ears! And wait til you do! Theyâre literally like butter! 

This gentle giant is playful and goofy, but heâs also capable of entertaining himself for hours on end with any type of chew toy. Pigs ears, rawhide sticks, Himalayan chews - - you name it, heâll take it! Buddy travels well in a car, will come when you say the name Buddy and understands what the word no means. He seems to be a real bright boy and you can tell that heâs eager to keep learning and growing.

Quite the chowhound, Buddy prefers wet dog food, but in the end, will pretty much eat anything. Without a doubt, his favorite food is chicken. Pass the drumstick, please! ;-)

Snare gets along beautifully with other canines and thrives at the dog park where he enthusiastically interacts with pooches of all shapes and sizes. A gentle lad, Snare allows the bossier-type dogs to do their thing and never looks to challenge them. Peace, bro...you can keep the tennis ball!

Snare walks nicely on a leash, travels calmly in a car, and is generally on the quiet side. He has a hearty appetite and gobbles up his favorite treats with gusto (more cheese, pleeeez!), but heâs so chill, you can literally put your hand in his food bowl and he will not react.

Snare is a very cuddly, snuggly, sensitive, people-oriented kinda pup, and is good with children. Heâs initially a bit reserved around folks heâs never met, but he is very much motivated by affection. A soft voice, a pat on the head, a scratch behind the ear - - thatâs all he needs to be a friend for life...and the most loyal, loving friend youâll ever find!

He looooves to meet people along the way when he's not busy pouncing on leaves as they blow across the sidewalk.  Despite being a rickety old man, he has a playful pep in his step that inspires all his fans to narrate his every move in a dopey voice to match his silly energy -- and on the flip side, he can be determinedly lazy for 15 hrs straight while he practices his most inventive napping positions!  In his past life, Gus lived harmoniously with another dog, a cat, and children, and he has met some new dog friends since.

How cute is this big gal?? She reminds us of a hippo!Her foster mom describes Baby as a gentle giant! She is such a sweet, sweet girl who has so much love to offer a lucky guardian or family. She loves nothing more than to be cuddled and petted, to be near her humans, or on a sunny day, outside, lounging. She loves playing games of fetch or tug ... and she loves her antlers, marrow bones and rubber toys ... inside, she loves to chill at your feet or when invited on the couch. She is a very mellow girl, low key and calm. Her foster mom feels she knows she was saved from the shelter and seems to be a very thankful soul. Baby would thrive in a home perhaps with a retired couple or a quiet home. She does not need a lot of exercise! She does require eye drops 2x a day. 

Baby is good with other dogs, though prefers to be solo. Probably no cats. She is good with kids and with strangers, and is good on the leash. She is house trained and crate trained. This wonderful girl deserves only the most loving, caring home, one committed to give her the love, safety and security for the rest of her days ...we promised her that.

This teeny pocket pit/Boston Terrier mix is named after the shelter she comes from! 

Brooklyn is the most adorable, compact girl with the cutest big ears and huge round eyes! She is a sweet, small, smart little girl who has charmed her foster mom and family. 

Her foster mom says Brooklyn LOVES going for walks and is doing really well on a no-pull harness. She ADORES her humans and is a true cuddle bug. Though fine with kids, we recommend older kids over 7 since she is exuberant and can knock over a toddler. And Brooklyn should be solo dog in the home.

Brooklyn loves to play and would thrive in an active home where she gets her sufficient, daily exercise. And with a guardian who knows, respects and loves the breed and will continue her training. 

A fenced in yard would be ideal, plus walks! She is house trained and crate trained, and seems to not be destructive at all when left out.

Their foster mom says that they are great on and off leash, good WITH THE CATS and other farm animals. They both come when called. They are GREAT in the car!

Back in the home, she loves to cuddle and is a true couch potato!

QUEEN will thrive in a home that is loving, caring and committed to keeping her safe and happy forever! She will also love with a guardian or family who takes her for her daily walks.

Meet Maverick!

Maverick is such a wonderful canine! So sweet natured, he loves his humans. He will make someone an exceptional companion for life. 

Maverick's ideal home would be one that continues his training (he has been with a trainer and has done great), gives him daily sufficient exercise in the form of runs, walks, hikes, ball playing, etc., so he can burn off his energy and stay happy and balanced. A home that gives him structure and boundaries. And one that will give him a grain free diet (he does have food allergies, but doing really well on the diet he's on, just a matter of giving grain free). 

Maverick should go to an adult only home or one with kids over ten. He is a bit picky about the dogs he is with, but has had success with females over 50 lbs. (Meet 'n greets to ensure compatibility is always needed.). 

Maverick has come a long way, and he is such a great dog! He can only go to the most loving, caring home, one committed to him for life, we promised him that! 

Maverick is house trained and crate trained. He is about two and half years old and weighs about 70 lbs. He is utd on his shot and is neutered and healthy.

Plus, she ADORES water! Baths, swims, a good run with the garden hose! 

Annie is very trainable and eager to please. She's been learning her leash manners from a trainer and doing great. 

Annie's ideal home? One that gives her lots of love, care and attention. Lots of walks and time outside in the fresh air. Though she might be fine with a submissive male (intros always needed); she would be perfectly okay as the solo queen bee. An adult only home or one with older kids. 

... And a home that loves her unconditionally and is committed to her for life, we promised this very special girl that!

Willemenia is very sweet when alone and all is quiet. However, she would be much happier in a home with no children and no other pets.   

She makes good use of a scratching post.

Her current family has found that the arrival of a baby has brought a change in Willemenia's gentle soul, and her fear of the strange little one has done her an injustice.  As much as the family adores her, it is clear that their cat would b happier elsewhere.

Simone gets around, but needs a very, very low litter box. She would probably do best with a wee wee pad holder rather than a box to get into. She sometimes acts out a bit and uses something strewn on the floor instead of her box.  Otherwise, she's like any other cat--just more adorable and laudable for her efforts to be a typical cat.  She  has a condition called Cerebellar Hypoplasia, which is a neurological condition resulting from a pre-natal infection.  It does no impair her health or longevity, but it does make her cuter than you can imagine.  She wobbles and tumbles at times, but she's just fine that way--she thinks it's normal.

During dinner Buddy will respect your spaceâ¦ as long as he gets a taste when you're having his favorite: refried beans!

She was born with cerebellar hypoplasia (a harmless, not health-impairing neurological condition) and will always need some management.  The good news is, it doesn't stop her from living a full and happy life.  She's a little messy with her canned food (she doesn't drink much water, so she needs wet food for hydration) and exclusively uses her playpen as her litter box (with a wee wee pad inside).

As you can see in the photos, he has fared quite well in boarding--the last shot, sitting up, shows how thin he was upon rescue, and the other two, well--he's just right!

Our San Juan came in to Manhattan's city shelter as a stray. His tail wasn't working--it was just there, injured, having suffered nerve damage. The tail was amputated, but the nerve damage was a little more far reaching: San Juan wasn't able to urinate on his own, and the urine had to be expressed twice daily so as not to allow toxins to back up as well as for comfort.   HOWEVER...he has healed, and this issue is gone.  One in a while, he poops outside of the box, but we think this may be because of his multi-cat environment.  

His behavior is ""beginner""--which means he's easy to handle, affectionate and friendly.  He is really a lovely boy.

San Juan is vaccinated and felv/fiv negative. He will be neutered shortly.

All three were born with a condition called cerebellar hypoplasia, resulting from an infection in the part of the brain that manages motor function.  As you can see in the video, they have no clue that anything is wrong. They use the litter box, eat (even if a bit messy) and play like normal cats--because they are!  Simone is picky, however, and will use something other than litter box at times. Her condition will not worsen, and is not health or life-threatening, though she cannot be in a home with stairs.

These two lovable house cats have been recently abandoned and are living on the street. They need a good foster home or an adoption, and this neighbor is willing to help pay the bills.
The two, recently abandoned house cats are clearly related, but thereâs also a third young grey one that is more shy and might be feral. The rescuer spoke to someone on the block who said that the owner of the two house cats had recently moved.

The cats are now living outside and people in the neighborhood have put food out for them but it is very close to the streets. The rescuer has too many rescued animals to foster them, but they need a temporary (or permanent) home while we can go through the right process to get them adopted.

832,"We pulled 6 year old Saturday on the recommendation of the New Hope personnel at one of the city shelters.  

When evaluated, he was found to be soliciting attention, head-butting for more petting, and particularly liked to be petted on the head and body.  Saturday will allow you to pick him up, but will not stay in your arms long, jumping down when he is ready.  He is described to be mellow, shy, sweet and curious.  In fact, the assessor gave him the best rating: Beginner, meaning that even a first time cat owner would be fine with him.

We think he has been with us too long, and don't think that he should be with small children, as he shuts down and will not respond well to poking and the like.  However, he remains a sweet cat and once in a home and not a cage, will blossom. (He loves being out of his cage at his boarding facility.).
This cat is neutered, vaccinated and felv/fiv negative.

Saturday is currently in residence in one of our favorite boarding facilities, Woofs 'n' Whiskers, at 14 Coles Street, in Redhook, Brooklyn.  718-237-0298 to check their hours.

833,"Gentle sweet older by, Salem is moderately impaired with a neurological birth defect (cerebellar hypoplasia, or CH) that causes him to stumble quite a bit.  He gets where he needs to go, but sometimes needs some help with stability.  He can't jump or do stairs, but he LOVES to cuddle and will drool with pleasure when receiving (and giving!) affection.  He follows you around quietly, although he does sometimes like to chat.  He uses a litter box with low or no front or wee wee pads.  Neutered, vaccinated, tested (negative) and microchipped.

Of course, any other pet he is with has to be friendly and gentle, as Salem's defenses are limited.

This cat is neutered, vaccinated and felv/fiv negative.

834,"Brooklyn and Neb were adopted from us as kittens, but returned to us due to their adopter's finances and relocation.  This bonded pair are sweet mature cats who need a home with lots of love.  Neb (the older one, black)is outgoing and a real lap cat.  He loves belly rubs and loves to sleep on top of you.  Brooklyn (tortie) is more skeptical, but also demands attention when Neb isn't hogging it all.  They have lived with another cat, would be great with children but dogs are an unknown:  Neb would probably do fine, Brooklyn might not.  Brooklyn and Neb are spayed/neutered, vaccinated, felv/fiv negative, and microchipped.  Neb needs a special diet.  Several years ago he had an issue with FLUTD, but has been asymptomatic since being on a urinary diet (Hill's C/D).

835,"They were born from a Feral mother our volunteers  trapped back in May. Sylvester and Marce  are about 10 months old, and love to play together, showing great, high energy. 

Sylvester is very sweet once he gets to know you. He loves to be petted, and is all over his foster mom.  .

Marce, too, is  sweet, but she needs an experienced owner, who will understand that coming over to play or cuddle must be HER decision, not the owner's. Petting, too, is much appreciated--but at Marce's request.

Neither of them enjoys being picked up, so it's best to leave that for when it's really necessary, like annual vet visits. (On the other hand, you can see in their photos that they were not squirmy, angry or uncomfortable.)

Marce and Sylvester should be the only two pets in the house.

Marce is spayed, vaccinated and felv/fiv negative.
Sylvester is neutered, vaccinated and felv/fiv negative.

836,"Some know all-too-well how big girls can be wrongly overlookedâbut please, donât pass up this one. Rhea, who was close to 16 pounds when rescued, offers her lucky adopter sweet, but timid, cat companionship. She will warm up in your home as she has in our home-like boarding facility.  She is not aggressive, and has lived with cats in boarding.  

	Rhea has a moderate heart murmur, but perhaps a carefully monitored diet will help that. We had an echocardiogram done, and she requires no treatment or medication. She came to us with a typical shelter cold, and is now fine.

	Rhea is 2 years old, vaccinated, felv/fiv negative., and  her spay surgery was uneventful.

837,"Benny and Bongo are two sweet  year olds, adopted from us as kittens but now in need of a new home.  The first two photos are Benny, and the others are Bongo.

The boys have a condition acquired in utero called ""cerebella hypoplasia,"" or ""CH."" It is not life-threatening, contagious, or harmful in any way, except it affects their motor skills. Take a look at the 2nd picture of Benny and see his wide stance with his back legs.  That is for balance, and these cats (all with CH) tend to cope beautifully.

These boys are loving and friendly. We don't have information about them with children and other pets, but most CH cats are just fine with all the above.

She is simply perfect:  she's friendly, wants to be with her person/people all the time, and wants to sleep with them, too.  She has lived with other cats, and now says ""ENOUGH!

839,"Strudel is as sweet as his name.  He was found as a stray, and his behavior, below, suggests he was socialized.

840,"Somehow this lovely, large boy was found as a stray.  At about 3 years old, he is a very well-fed fellow.   Right from the beginning at the city shelter, he was ""very sweet, easily handleable and cooperative during his  evaluation at the shelter.  

His behavior evaluation showed no less:
While initially a little tense, he settled down nicely and was found to warm up with attention, sniffing the assessor's hand and leaning in for pets and rubs on his cheeks and body. He gives head butts, too.  His activity level is mellow, he is quiet and curious, and shy, and affectionate.

841,"This really lovely 13 year old was surrendered to the shelter by her previous owner. We are not privy to her past, but her present is the story of a lovely cat. The owner reported friendly behaviors to all people and the city shelterâs behavior specialist had this to say:

Looks up and comes towards cage door on seeing the assessor. She is calm and neutral when spoken to. She begins to rub against cage door as the assessor 
opens it. 
She leans in for more rubs when touches, rolling around, soliciting more interaction.
She allows being picked up, but perhaps not for long periods. 
Bingo is mellow, quiet, sweet, social and affectionate.
Summary: Beginner behavior (suitable for any home).

Bingo is quite a find. She is spayed, vaccinated and felv/fiv negative.

846,"Foster update: Hi everyone, I'm Ruby (also know as Ruby Dooby, Doobs) around my house. I am about 5 years old and thankfully found by the NYPD, where they took me to the Manhattan ACC. I got to meet Rachael and the team at Muddy Paws Rescue and even though I was really sad my first night, they were so awesome, they knew I'd be a great fit to join the pack. My pal Rachael decided on a place outside the city, which is cool, because I am loving living with my foster moms Liza and Suzy and foster bros Jack and Fable. I just had a litter of puppies, whom I hope are safe and warm and as lucky as I am to have a nice cozy couch to lounge on and friends to give me lots of love and kisses. I am still kind of recovering from getting spayed a few days ago, so sometimes I have fun bursts of energy and can't control myself with all the doggy kisses I want to give, but generally I am really happy just relaxing and hanging with these awesome hoomans and my dog pals. It's been a blast so far living in a big house with lots of space and a nice yard, which I am told I need to go to the bathroom in more often instead of inside (still working on remembering this). I don't particularly like when they put me back inside my crate, but it does come outfitted with a nice blankey that usually soothes me into quiet nap-time, but between you and me I'd rather snuggle in a bed or on the couch if you gave me the choice. Still taking applications for new friends, so let me know if you want to meet. Love, Ruby Ruby is a 5 year old Pitbull Terrier mix who is fully grown at 49 lbs.

855,"Jamie is a sleek, slender black cat with gorgeous gold eyes. She is very friendly with cats and dogs! She loves cat toys, especially her green pompom atop a flexible stalk fixed to a black base -- which she carries (drags, really) around the apartment, despite the fact that it's almost half as big as she is. Once she has put it down, she wants it to stay.Â  If someone tries to move it, Jamie promptly corrects the misstep. Jamie is a very sweet cat, without an aggressive bone in her body.
Although she loves other cats and is super friendly, Jamie, at this present time, prefers to not be petted on her back or picked up.Â  Jamie knows her name and comes when called.Â  She gathers in her foster mommy's room with the other cats for feeding and eats from the plate she is given. She sniffs her FM's hand and occasionally puts her paw gently on her arm. She also eats treats out of her human's hand.

865,"From Cosita's foster: 
Cosita is a cat that appreciates her solitude and  independence as much as wanting to be side-by-side with you whereever  you go!Â  She is not a lap cat (unless she has something more solid than  your legs to lay on), but I feel that this is solely because she was  never given the opportunity while she was young; therefore, she is  apprehensive about sitting on your lap.Â  While she isn't a kitty who  will lie right next to you she does like to sit at the end of the couch  and then come to you when she wants to be petted.Â  
She is very affectionate and extremely vocal, especially when  she is hungry.Â  She expresses her affection sometimes through play.Â   What I mean by this is when you are petting her, on a dime, she will  quickly grab you and start nipping at your hand or arm.Â  This is not  aggression by any means, just play as a cat would.Â  Whenever she begins  nipping at me I usually stop moving and then she will stop as well.Â   Again, this is not aggression.Â  
One thing that I have noticed, and this is probably due to  her younger years of experience, she is very sensitive to sound and  usually reacts by slinking her posture.Â  Since she has been with me, she  has become familiar with the sounds around the building, so she reacts  less, but at times she may still be startled.Â  She never, however, was  skittish.Â  She is one tough cookie that will definitely defend her  territory....It is worth mentioning that she has always calmly napped  near me when I am practicing my instrument.
My recommendation is that she is adopted by someone that has a  busy life, but wants to come home to a companion that will always greet  them at the door and wants to sleep near them.Â  I say this because she  works well in the ""time-share"" principle.Â  When she has her time alone,  she is always willing to share space with whomever once they walk  through that door.Â  She also likes spending the whole day with you too,  but I wanted to highlight a living style that works well for her (my  opinion of course).Â  I do want to note, that in my opinion (and in the  right circumstance), she will do well with another animal.Â  Cosita is  not a cat keen on being picked up and held so potential adopters should  be aware of this. 
She was born around 4/7/07. "
866,Grace and Marcia are both very shy girls. They have lived with other cats and small dogs but they are not too fond of the dogs.Â  They would do very well in a home together as they are very bonded. Both girls love to be petted but prefer not to be picked up. They are shy so they need time to adjust to strangers and would do best in a home with an experienced cat owner with no small children. Grace was born to Marcia around 4/26/12. And Marcia was born around 11/25/10.
867,"I love giving head-butts and having my neck rubbed, and I'll let you know when I've had enough petting. Other hobbies include eating and lounging on a comfy bed. I long for a home where I can be your only cat, but can also share with another calm kitty. While I am on special food for my diabetes, I donât need any medication. Just the love of a special person. 

I was born around 6/30/09."
868,"Lady is an exquisite white shorthair who has become the den mother of the Cat Room and Petco 100. She grooms and cares for all the cats and has many friends. She also loves to give headbutts to people. She can become a little overstimulated when other cats are agitated or upset, but she loves affection and does well in a calm environment. Lady is a beautiful older cat who loves to care for others. As you can see from the photo, she has taken little Alex under her wing and loves kittens. She was born around 3/1/04."
869,"Donny (male) and Tula (female) were born around 6/12/12.Â  Both are very playful and snuggly and love to be petted. They don't love to be held as much but tolerate it and are more than willing to snuggle if they are approached. Donny and Tula should be adopted together. They play together all the time and love grooming each other and it would be a shame to deprive them of that.
Â "
870,"Patty is a very sweet girl who has been through too much for her young 5 years.Â  The only family that it appears she ever had was with an owner who died, with Patty then seized by police and delivered to the ACC.Â  She seems to have been an only cat and it is obvious that she was well loved.Â  She gives great head bumps when you reach your hand out to her and will purr and roll over for a belly rub.Â  She would likely be happiest as an only cat, although she is beginning to adapt to other cats in her foster home.Â  She would be perfect for someone who wants a single kitty constant companion and lover girl! Patty was born around 9/2/07."
871,"Betty is a little shy at first but give her a chance and she'll becomes very friendly once she gets to know you. She isn't a great fan of being picked up and held as she has things to do!Â  She has been with another cat before and there was a little initial hissing but then things settled quite well.
Betty loves to flop near her foster wherever he may be. If he's in his recliner, she ends up on it with him by his side. She likes to help when her foster dad works by stretching out all over his papers on the living room table.Â  She loves head rubs and will grab at your hand with her paws and/or mouth if you pull away before she wants you too. Belly rubbing is ok but she will lightly nip if it goes on longer than she wants. So she is a smart cat who lets you know when enough is enough!Â  She does the ol' rub up on the legs when you are standing near her... She is quite playful with her toys, tossing them around and chasing after them. She is also quite the acrobat, balancing on the edge of chairs, batting at her tail while she hangs off the edge- again, too cute.
Betty was born around 2/26/10."
872,"Suli is mommy to Sandy, Sullivan and Sonia who will be ready for their new homes around 10/16/12.Â Â  At that time Suli will be looking for her own home too!
Sullivan - Sullivan is a sweet, calm boy, who loves to cuddle.Â  He is very easy going.
Sonia - Sonia loves attention, and can always be found playing with her brothers.
Sandy - Sandy is a loveable boy, who loves to give kisses.Â  Sandy also loves playing with his brother and sister.
Suli - Suli is a sweet and calm cat.Â  She is relaxed and friendly, and loves to be petted and give headbutts."
873,"Jesi is smart and loves other cats. She is shy, but when she comes around, she is very sweet. She loves to drown her toy mice in the water bowl! This cutie is ready for her forever home"
874,"Cynthia is a soft, affectionate sweetie who gets along with people and cats.  She'll charm you with kisses and keep you cozy on winter nights.  At her foster home, she quickly made herself comfortable on the bed, and two days later, she woke up her foster mom with a gentle paw touch and a nose kiss.  She's a generally calm cat who enjoys being petted and brushed (she likes to eat the brush!), although she doesn't love being held (we're working on it).  She loves to play, jump and watch the birds from the screened window.  If you want company while you work or cook, Cynthia is your girl.  

Cynthia would enjoy having a kitty friend at her new home.  She quickly made friends with her foster sister Sophy and they are very cute togetherâwrestling, tumbling and bathing each other.  She would love a home where she'll get a lot of attention and would probably do well with older children.  She is a bit shy at adoption events, so please come visit Cynthia at her foster home on the UES.  She might roll upside down to show you her tummy and, if you're lucky, even nibble on your hair to win your heart.  She was born around 11/29/10.

875,"From Cookie's Foster:
Cookie is a petite girl with really neat markings.Â  She seeks out attention and enjoys being petted.Â  She has such a distinctive personality.Â  She is playful and energetic, but not too crazy.Â  She likes to play with other cats.Â  She is good natured, enjoys being held and like to sleep in the bed or sit in our lap.Â  She needs to go with an experienced cat person that won't misinterpret her rough and tumble play.Â  She love bites and I have to think that as a kitten she was played with aggressively.Â  I am working on getting her to be gentler.Â  She is responsive to me and then gives me kisses.Â  Her marking are distinct as well, and she has this expression on her face when she's playing that makes me laugh.Â  She really is fun. Cookie was born around 6/3/11."

If you can't already tell from my photos and video that I am a fun loving guy, let me just assure you that I LOVE to play. Some things happened in my owner's life that made it hard to keep a dog around, so now I have a big yard to play with some of my dog buddies at the All About Labs ranch. I was born in 2008 and even though I am super playful, I am crate trained too (but would need some outdoor time for playfulness);  get along with people large or small as long as they are loving and want to play, but I would probably do better in a home without really small children because they might not be able to keep up with my energy.

Meet Kat! Heâs enormously fat. Couldnât stand so he sat. What do you think about that? But seriously, this new 10-year-old rescue is gigantically overweight. We just welcomed him and his equally plus sized, stripy brother Iggy into the Social Tees fam. These big boys are now on a special diet with a gentle exercise regimen, and they are super cool! Theyâre the kind of cats that make people who arenât into felines reconsider their firm stance. Kat and Iggy are each about 19 lbs but need to lose handfuls, they are easy going and love affection, and theyâre good with other animals. Interested in adopting?

Iggy is a big stud. And by big, we not only mean intensely studdy, we mean BIG. This handsome boy is way overweight, but he's on a special regimen now so the pounds will just melt away/stubbornly and aggressively cling to his body for a while as he shrinks back to normal cat size little by little. This kind new 10-year-old rescue is a little shy at first but easy going and loves affection. We rescued him and his brother Kat together, so it would be nice to see them go to a home as a pair but they do not seem bonded as they tend to stick to themselves for the most part. Theyâre good with other animals and love cheeck scratches. Interested in adopting? Submit an application at socialteesnyc.org!

This extremely loving and handsome Pitbull/Staffordshire Bull Terrier mix is about 4 years old, 50 lbs, friendly with everyone, great with other dogs outside the home, housebroken, crate trained, and eager to please. Vincent is not a good match for a home with cats and should ideally be the only pet in the home because he wants his humans and his space all to himself... but otherwise gets along well with pretty much everyone and would do best in an active home where he can get plenty of walks and playtime.

926,"CHEVRIL and the rest of the litter are super adorable, 13-week old Hound/Shep Mixes. They are btw 13-16 lbs currently and will grow to be 55-60lbs fully grown. They are very well socialized with other dogs, learning to use the bathroom outside and are so smart they will learn commands in minutes. They love all and every human they meet, always a tail wag away. These guys would do best in an active home so that they can grow up to be the best version of themselves.

927,"CINNAMON is a 13-week-old shepherd/hound mix is friendly and loving and an epic playmate. Sheâll likely be in the 50s or 60s weight wise full grown and will thrive in an active home. Her foster mom says: âCinnamon is the sweetest angel who loves to sniff, explore, and play with everyone she meets, dogs and humans alike! She is overall just full of love and is the sweetest girl. She loves to cuddle. She sleeps right at our feet. She gets a little anxious at night. Wakes us up to play at 6 am but after going outside to pee she goes right back to sleep. She is in love with my old lady dog. A 15-year-old pitbull that is too old for this little baby but definitely entertains her and lets her jump at her and play. Cinnamon follows her around and wants to sleep with her every chance she gets. Sheâs very well behaved for a puppy. High energy but listens well. Watch out for your socks though. Sheâs been collecting all of ours. She is working on peeing outside. The first couple days were kind of a mess but now that sheâs more comfortable sheâs holding for longer and waiting for us to take her outside. If she goes in the house itâs only on the training pads. Weâre really enjoying spending time with her.â Interested in adopting? Apply at socialteesnyc.org!

He loves to play with other dogs and use that hound nose of his. Loves humans, long walks and endless cuddle sessions. He is a great tempered boy that is a show stopper no matter where he goes. We would love to place him in an active home outside of the city. Since he is a hound boy, he should not be around cats, that can get him a bit too curious ;-) His foster mom shares ""Hoss is such a gem - anyone would be so lucky to adopt this boy. He is very loving and a great cuddler. Heâs happy to gallop in the yard and play fetch or hang out and watch tv, as long as heâs with his people. We've lovingly nicknamed him Pony because of his long legs and graceful stature, plus he loves to gallop after his toys! He's super smart and loves to be around people. Heâs a great listener and obeys commands well. We are working on his leash training and he improves on every walk!"" Apply now!

Hannah is a 5 year old Pom Mix. She is about 12 lbs, very sweet, gentle and well behaved. Good with dogs and people, this little gem would make someone REALLY happy. She is a low key girl that would do amaizng in a medium active home . Hannah is medium active and a medium snuggler. She does insist on sleeping in bed curled up next to you. She's totally housebroken.

Hannah loves other dogs. Sometimes she gets too excited when she sees another dog but calms right down once shes able to say hello. Because of this she may be too much for a home with a cat. She doesn't chase squirrels or birds though. Hannah is a gentle sweetie and would be fine around kids.

939,"Rescued from the train tracks at the 103rd Street Station in Harlem on the 6 line, 1.5 year old Choo Choo Train (also known as Sir Cank-a lot for his big cankles and Stubville, for his little nubbin tail) had a badly infected piece of a tail that had to be amputated, making him an ""artificial Manx.""  Through it all, he purred, nuzzled, head-butted, and showed love to every human and animal he has encountered. 

After he spent months at the vet's office in boarding, following his surgery and recovery in the Spring of 2018, I brought him home to a house filled with cats, and he blended in seamlessly, as he is not dominant at all, and is easy going and just wants to have fun. 

ChooTrain loves to run laps around the apartment and bird watch on the windowsill (literally sitting still while pigeons are inches from him, and he just stares at them).  He sometimes also likes to lay next to my head at night, or find a cozy elevated spot on a cat tree.  Out of all of the years that I've been rescuing and bringing cats home...he is easily one of the best, and he made it so easy to help him.

940,"Rocky has been stuck at a cage at our vet's office for months...he was rescued by a very nice man who had nowhere to put him, so he has boarded him at the vet.  We noticed him there every time we would visit, and when we started to talk to him and pet him, we saw just how sweet he was.  

The reason why no one wants Rocky is that he has FIV, but as cat rescuers, we know that this is not contagious!  We have had FIV cats in our homes with our other cats for many years, and it does not spread in the traditional ways that diseases spread.  Rocky does not deserve a life of depression in a cage because of something that is not even contagious!

Please find it in your heart to foster Rocky until he can get a home.  He is gentle, handsome, and very grateful for every hello and scratch on the chin he can get.  Here are some videos we shot of him last night (6/1/2018):  https://www.amazon.com/photos/share/1rJOm9EcmPulwcVjaUir9W0Fnl9yhjWLAVpNQPsrvbS

941,"Siri was the only surviving pup of 6 puppies who were fighting to survive on the streets of South Thailand.  She was rescued by the local shelter and has thrived and recovered from her traumatic early-life experience. 

As of early October 2018, she is approximately 9 months old.  She is very friendly and playful and gets along with all dogs and people.  She just arrived in NYC the last week of September, and is doing very well with the big adjustment--she is playful, content, attentive.  She initially had issues with climbing stairs, which all international dogs have problems with, but within a day or two, she learned how to go up and down one flight indoors, and is improving every day.  She is also learning quickly how to walk on a leash.  

We are primarily looking for someone to foster Siri as we search for her forever home, or an adopter who feels that she is a good fit.  We do not have a shelter, and we rely solely on foster homes to house our rescued dogs. 

For serious inquiries, please contact FurRealNYC@gmail.com.  Thank you."

943,"Loon (who is actually called ""Lung"" in Thai, which means uncle) is a loving, gentle, submissive street dog from the North of Thailand.  He sustained a leg injury which forces him to hold his rear left leg up, but he functions normally and is fully mobile with this condition (we had the vet in Thailand conduct x-rays and do a full examination of his leg).  He is neutered and approximately 2 years old, and around 34 lbs.  He arrived in NYC from Thailand on 9/26/2018 and he is very active, runs like a greyhound (on three legs!).

Loon is submissive with humans, and tends to get along well with most dogs, as long as they are not aggressive with him.  Despite living a very hard life on the streets in a place where street dogs are poisoned, hit by vehicles, and seen as a nuisance, he has been both physically resilient and has kept joy and love in his heart, and shares that spirit of love with everyone he meets.  

Loon would do well in a home with or without dogs, and would be fine with children and/or cats, and an adopter who will not judge him for his weird leg.  He gets around just fine and won't love you any less because of his physical condition.  Here are a couple of videos so that you can see how he gets around on 3 legs:

944,"Diamond was rescued off of the streets of Thailand 2 years ago after local residents tried to poison him.  He was taken in by a rescuer, who, due to lack of adoptive homes, boarded him for the past 2 years!  We found out about his story in August of 2018 and wanted to help, and had him transported to NYC from Bangkok at the end of September so that we can find this boy a loving, forever home on the East Coast. 

He is a mix of beagle and Golden, and is an all-around great boy--active, playful, affectionate, and loyal.  We know that Diamond would be an asset to any home that would welcome him.  He is 45-50 lbs., and would like to be the only pet in his household, walks very well on a leash, and is very active.  He is approximately 4 years old.  

We are desperate for a permanent home for Diamond.  Since arriving in NYC at the end of September 2018, we have had a lot of inquiries for him, but we need someone with experience and preferably a single person or a couple (or one person with one roommate) to adopt him.  We don't believe he'd do well in a large household with many roommates or family members.  He wants to focus on his 1-2 humans and be a loyal companion and take long walks with his special humans.  He has shown some aggression to some men, while living with 4 men and being very close and loyal to them, and we believe it's because he has become very territorial since arriving in NYC.  So, we need an adopter who can handle a territorial dog, and the benefit is that he will protect you and your home as his first priority.  

Please reach out to us at FurRealNYC@gmail.com if you are interested in this beautiful boy."

These boys just need a new place to hang out. They are all low maintenance- they came from a senior who was sick and whose home unfortunately we not fit for human nor animal to live. They are very happy to just ""be"" cats.

Timothy(light orange with cinnamon nose) is about 6 - 8 yrs old. He is just a love - sweet, friendly, vocal. He LOVES people. He enjoys playing with his toys and being brushed. He is Super super sweet; very playful. Loves to chase the kitty âbirdiesâ and thoroughly enjoys being pet. He comes running at you - tail high - to get his morning hellos

Bob (grey) is about 10- 12 yrs old He is just the sweetest most friendly cat and loves attention and enjoys a good conversation and kisses on the head. He also loves to head butt his human :). Loves to be pet and brushed. He feels teeth are overrated, hence he has none. Loves to sleep on chairs, he feels cat beds are too small for him! Just sweet beyond belief.

Oscar is about 7-9 yrs old. He is a bit more subdued. Sweet and quiet. He sometimes does his own thing but loves hanging with his buddy Bob. He is people friendly but a little more aloof. Heâs got spunk, loves to play with kitty toys. Meows but no sound comes out:0 and sometimes he has a little cattitude but he still looks for affection and enjoys being pet.

Jenny is about 10ish and is both visually and hearing impaired. She has some arthritic issues as well but is very content walking around the yard a bit and laying in the sun. She seems to be a Chinese crested powder puff., a very sweet little girl.

Missy is younger- maybe 8 or so; she is a bit more active than Jenny but again, very very sweet. She too enjoys her time in the yard and enjoys spending time with Jenny. She is a bit more playful than Jenny. Both are as sweet as can be. She is a mix. Missy will be having her eye removed next week.

They are bonded and cannot be separated. They would do best with someone home during the day who can give them the TLC they deserve at this point in their lives. Neither of them like the camera!!

They would do best with a yard.

950,"Meet June. She is a beautiful, soft six year old orange tabby. She was rescued from a horrible hoarding situation. She lived in squalor with twenty other cats.

She was skinny and dirty when she was first rescued. June is fine with other cats and dogs once she gets to know them. She is still very hesitant with people and will need a family who will shower her with time, space, love and understanding.

June has been spayed and is utd on her vaccinations. Let this beautiful girl become part of your family today.

An Orange female is unusual, most orange cats are boys.

952,"Tiger is a 2 year old, male pittie/lab mix and his best friend Patty is a 3 year old, female staffie mix. Both were pulled from different NY shelters. Patty came to us afraid of anything and everything- it took a while for her to come out of her shell and this happened when she met Tiger. She has found her confidence with him with his loving personality and they are truly bonded. Tiger was pulled minutes before his scheduled euthanasia; scheduled for no other reason other than he was at a shelter which euthanizes daily due to space. Tiger was an owner surrender because his original owners moved and could not bring him. Patty was surrendered by her previous owner due to ownerâs illness and could no longer care for her. Tiger came from a family with young children and dogs. They are both great with other dogs and children. They are both incredibly sweet dogs. Tiger loves to play fetch and swim in his pool; his best friend Patty just watches him. They love to run together. Tiger truly has brought Patty out of her shell- she is very sad without him. We cannot split them up. Will someone please open their hearts to two amazing animals? They are both fixed and fully vetted and so ready to get out of the kennel and get into a home. They would both make an amazing pet therapy team.

953,"Meet BARLEY>>>>>

4.5 year old Staffie/American Bull dog mix. He weighs 50 lbs, is neutered and utd on his shots.

His dad for his whole life was going to euthanize him because Barley did not get along with his new wife or her dog. His dad had nowhere to turn as Barley is not a dog for everyone. He would do best in a home with no children and probably would do best with no other animals. He is dog selective. Although we know he was going to be a difficult placement, we took Barley in as to euthanize him was not an option. He has been with a wonderful behaviorist who has had the opportunity to get to know him and work with him.

He is happy and friendly dog but likes his space. He is not aggressive but will let you know when you are in his space. He is 100% housebroken and crate trained, plays well and gives up his toys when asked. He is not dog aggressive; he is more dog neutral. He would prefer not to interact with them.

Barley is a great housedog. He has had no issues being left alone and has shown to be reliably housebroken. He is crate trained and loves his crate. He loves hanging out, curling up and napping while you are watching TV; he will play ball or frisbee if invited and plays very politely. He is not at all demanding of your time or attention, rather he politely accepts it when offered. He used to hike and bike with his former guardian and he loves kayaking (had his own lifejacket). He is built for it (on the small side for this type of dog and muscular). He pulls a little on the leash initially, but after 15 feet or so, slows down and walks nicely. He has a happy, goofy side when playing- which is very sweet. He just needs that right person who will understand who he is and what he needs- and he will be the best friend ever.

These 2 very bonded girls had a family for all their 8 years. Their mom passed away and dad brought them to the vet to be put to sleep, he said he didn't know what else to do. They are now living in a cage at the vet, and are desperately hoping a home will come through for them.

Thelma is the Calico, Louise is the black and white. They are very very sweet and have been through a lot. The cage they are in is small. They need a home to walk around and a lap to sit on. Louise may need fluids down the line for her kidneys, but for now she is okay. Often things arise from stress, and they definitely are stressed.

Please consider these girls, they really need you. Thank you.

960,"Jerry is an 8 year old, 10lb Yorkie! 

Jerry enjoys going on walks and is well behaved on the leash. Jerry might take a while to warm up to new people so he would be best in a quiet environment with NO children and not too much interaction with people. Once he warms up to you he loves his belly rubs and getting petted but only by people he knows. Although he doesnt like when strange people try to pet him, he will take treats gently from new folks. 

Jerry has some issues resource guarding toys so we would recommend that he not be allowed to have them, with gradual introduction with positive reinforcement that it's good to share. He is treat motivated so he think with work she should be able to overcome this. We would recommend an all adult home with experienced adopters willing to give him the time and attention he deserves!

Jerry is up to date on vaccines, microchipped and neutered. He has also had a dental cleaning.

She hasn't been crated at her foster - but kept in the kitchen when the foster is not home... and isn't happy about getting into a carrier - but she loves to sleep in the bed cuddled next to her human. All in all she is a love bug and seems to be happy to be rescued.

968,"Cheerio is a 10-lb., approximately one-year-old chihuahua mix who has been through a lot in his young life. He was surrendered to the city shelter when his family could no longer care for him. (He was said to have lived happily with a nine-year-old and another small dog.) 

Cheerio was very scared in the shelter - he made friends but would lie on his side, rub himself on the ground and whine from stress - and was set to be put down when Waggytail stepped in. In foster he has blossomed, with a gentle approach, into a joyful pup who loves to play fetch with his squeaky ball (which he carries out to the yard!), and to carouse with two small doggie housemates. He has taken the subway without issue, content to snooze in his carrier and stick his head out once in a while for a peek, and even sat calmly on the vet's exam table on his first visit. He loves walking in the park, stops once in a while to take in the scenery, and is learning to sit for treats in order to curtail his excitement at seeing kids, runners and dogs on the street. 

Cheerio is housebroken if kept on a regular schedule. He has a mild heart murmur that currently needs no treatment and has had no effect on his lust for life. His human and canine foster family love him, and hope he finds a home that introduces him slowly to more new experiences so his awesomeness can continue to unfold.

Cheerio is up to date on shots, microchipped, and will be neutered as a part of the adoption.

Hunter is a 4yo, 11lbs Terrier mix who just came to us from the at-risk list at ACC. Hunters perfect adopter will be patient, understanding, and experienced. Hunter has a few things going on medically that we are trying to pinpoint. Right now she has some hair loss, is skinny, and shows signs similar to a UTI. We are working closely with our veterinarian to identify exactly what is going on. Even though Hunter may not currently be feeling 100% she is still very sweet and loving. Her current foster has described her as a âVelcro dogâ once she has adjusted and is comfortable in her surroundings. Hunter is very quiet if not silent and is non-destructive. Her favorite place to be is on her personâs lap. Hunter is very good and will signal you when she needs to go out to potty (typically every 3-4 hours right now). She is learning to walk on a leash and can be a little reactive to other dogs but itâs a work in progress. We feel that the best home for Hunter will be a home with no young children.

Hunter is up to date on shot, microchipped, and will be spayed as a part of the adoption.

980,"Tiger is a 2 yr old, 10 lb, Chihuahua. He is a tiny bit shy but sweet, gentle and playful. He is affectionate and plays well with others, walks well on a leash, and is housebroken. He likes to bark at dogs on a walk but is harmless and really gets along great with his foster brother! He came from a ""neglect"" situation with another dog. He's a skinny little guy and can fit thru the smallest gap in the fence! 

His foster mom says "" Tiger is doing great so far! He rode the subway like an old pro, and he quickly made himself at home in my apartment. He and my resident dog immediately got along like old friends. They both sleep in bed with me, and every morning I wake up to find that Tiger's curled up right against my chest. He's such a little sweetheart! He's had a few accidents while he's getting used to his new schedule, but I'm sure he'll figure it out soon. He's comfortable in a crate (before I was even done setting up his kennel, he scurried in and plopped down). He has a little separation anxiety and cries and barks when I leave in the morning, but is settled down and calm when I get home after work. He walks wonderfully on the leash, and it only took him two days to be brave enough to walk up and down the stairs on his own!""

Tiger is fully vaccinated, heartworm negative, and neutered. He will be microchipped as part of adoption.
